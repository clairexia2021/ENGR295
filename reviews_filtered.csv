0,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Visuals Top, Movie Not",6,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces?

1,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning and action packed but story is light,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",sequel design look match first film longer impact ocean set bring new creatur us marvel breathtakingli new year ago lot action set piec great watch although feel either repetit borrow previou cameron film like titan bring back grace charact evil colonel felt much one grace sigorney weaver would suffici colonel could easili brother like die hard although would requir addit stori chang regard adolesc spider charact would better whole import famili theme run everyth much well let make sure incident charact die higher frame rate aspect ad noth extra time made feel like video like real film although interestingli video feel alway like hobbit film would come go stori film becom battl jake clone colonel rest global aspect pandora vers human drop waysid would interest new antagonist clone colonel disobey order gener goe awol hunt jake like captain ahab white whale
2,Avatar: The Way of Water,Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.,6,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",jame cameron film impress special effect camerawork world build action chart avatar way water struggl like predecessor stori charact develop depart fact stori way water almost ident first avatar instead human learn na vi fight stephen slang famili forest na vi learn ocean na vi fight stephen lang strength weak first movi back one bonu compar origin realli visual feast special effect masterpiec like first avatar
3,Avatar: The Way of Water,I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one,4,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved.

4,Avatar: The Way of Water,Empty beauty,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",jame cameron bring biggest disappoint year avatar noth empti beauti start hurri introduct plot narrat jake happi dude made kid somehow none explain well appar matter peopl evil reason jake flee beauti water world never hear forest world probabl destroy care genocid former tribe jake son touch whale touch way interest reason human send mile clone jake spend massiv amount money hunt even though object stop jake creat upris alreadi succeed jake lay low hide reason hunt still three hour movi avatar feel rush quit often subplot introduc hint get thrown away without resolv big plot point feel rush get spend half hour watch complet unnecessari whalehunt suppos get attach jake new kid one show depth charact one get bulli punish even father hard feel attach charact shallow husk dialogu absolut horrend rare get deeper come bro gotta bro famili bro overus bro madden bring alreadi terribl dialogu sub zero level none interact feel natur spider charact epitom horribl cast ad absolut noth plot polit ask mile stop kill time charact movi show depth develop whale kid end extrem lacklust new water tribe discard entir big fight water tribe help new friend cool wateri way join jake ride disappear get rehash begin fight five peopl watch past two hour thing alway done charact save fight whale end new waterworld set peopl noth beauti background instead someth actual play plot charact bad avatar look amaz action scene stun water world majest creatur beauti empti beauti substanc might biggest disappoint year movi wise
5,Avatar: The Way of Water,James Cameron's triumphant return,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",hard believ sequel avatar actual come year feel like half dozen delay offici someon surpris much movi held recent view therefor high expect sequel say live hype mayb littl less great sit littl longer could sure first movi long minut long feel length honesti got wrap movi look sound much probabl could gone anoth hour still felt restless one best pace hour movi ever seen could argu even pace littl fast first act thank time skip mean viewer caught speed quickli visual effect wise perfect numer expens blockbust releas everi year given time avatar clearli given look leagu better million plu movi releas last year great someth say often find stun new area pandora explor thank extens underwat scene stori wise say littl less predict first stori seem bother peopl anyth jame cameron might criticis borrow much introduc child charact made think alien termin part action scene avatar look littl familiar anyon seen titan abyss even termin littl corni dialogu coupl slightli clunki scene earli lack definit climax see sequel plan problem bare matter strength movi overwhelm make must watch cinema felt great see blockbust like
6,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is",6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

7,Avatar: The Way of Water,Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

8,Avatar: The Way of Water,"A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche",7,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",love first movi like love movi thin stori basic dialogu simplist outlook life stori yet first one movi beauti stori famili love cameron know pull string hollywood use great clearli cameron one last true director tinseltown complet sold think movi long think simplist worldview shade gray somewhat cring dialogu reduc score much fulli enjoy spectacl howev entertain stun look give lot prop feel movi someth experi get mention initi magic first movi definit still biggest box offic year sure cannot say great movi gave highli recommend especi love first one find movi bit cheesi anyth great felt first one

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ...

10,Avatar: The Way of Water,Damn James Cameron...,9,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron.

11,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning but very weak characters and story,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",prefac say huge jame cameron fan titan avatar list top ten movi time icon timeless suspens excit heartwarm cameron establish brand produc epic qualiti movi one howev mediocr unlik movi realli anyth special abyss breakthrough liquid anim titan epic scale love stori avatar revolutionari graphic great stori way water anyth realli stand open minut felt choppi fail creat emot traction sulli new famili motiv charact question also volatil one minut angri someon someth next minut help quaritch burn villag kill na vi dismiss apathet toward spider spider threaten goe soft sudden son even know use violenc especi quaritch complet illog pointless serv noth lame attempt shock audienc e burn metkayina villag person action charact especi children also annoy fail commun explain thing lead constant misunderstand fail listen constantli caus havoc anoth weak attempt depict angst teenag track edit also poor scene feel like stitch togeth one moment see jake famili practic someth enjoy see random scene quaritch back na vi also epic battl final whole movi build like first one avatar see thing start peac rda tri peac resolut school send jake thing slowli escal home tree destroy gradual need war end kid get captur fight move happi fight anoth kidnap final fight whale jake quaritch fist fight everyth feel weak loos wound conclus event steadi buildup tension last thing fair bit recycl dialogu camera angl motif first end exampl sulli say know take stand learn first one went war fight land forget one tri run away throughout movi come back realiz overal memor special movi felt like use stun visual crutch weak stori charact would much excit new villain much formid human mayb would team human fight instead recycl quaritch grace charact like new idea would nice end like dark knight built first movi took whole new level suspens storytel unfortun deliv frankli forgett

No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.",okay gunna write heart one mainli impact movi call movi entir famili sit imax theatr sound blast visual face via perfectli implement real experi movi realli feel confid exagger say complex well written nuanc stori ever creat movi massiv amount improv write first movi well realli kind movi bunch charact absolut ador end rememb forev outsid ot one particular charact love great deal sigourney nail movi need thing mention amaz experi draw breath lung part lip utter disbelief see time almost feel nope movi need exactli experi almost essenti biggest baddest bell whistl attach theatr screen possibl get cinema experi movi watch home smaller screen stream otherwis say similar first movi think okay mayb opinion movi person sit theatr surround sound imax whatev els watch film come end total unaffect miser person look someth never find last year endur speci hour magic film provid good theatr enough leav entir group entireti audienc sat within huge smile occasion teari eye upon credit roll buzz atmospher walk peopl look amaz seen sinc spider man nwh care say plot stori whatev tri less miser experi mani other ever forget wait next one pleas see cinema late
15,Avatar: The Way of Water,How does a script get ignored for 13 years?,4,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine.

16,Avatar: The Way of Water,Tiresome,3,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real.

17,Avatar: The Way of Water,One of the most visually innovative films ever,9,"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",film visual stun simpli seen biggest screen possibl best way enjoy film let consum stori one peopl get behind enhanc visual storytel screen look film detail much happen visual engulf say stori perfect hour runtim help flesh charact give stori depth weight realli get tv seri these day honestli could plot hole realli care look nitpick movi mayb rethink life enjoy one gorgeou piec art world ever produc think much work put amaz feel film got one best cinema experi ever probabl along dunkirk origin avatar releas akira know seen imax mayb would knock film park know probabl gonna see movi time least imax even mean broke one film breathtak

20,Avatar: The Way of Water,Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(,5,"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding.

21,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun",5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James!

22,Avatar: The Way of Water,Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ,1,"What the f did I just watch? Avatar 2 is probably one of the most boring movies you will ever see. There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.",f watch avatar probabl one bore movi ever see zero plot noth happen throughout entir movi realli bad somehow reviv charact first movi mission first movi first one actual plot even though realli gener one still much better excit throughout entir movi basic one long bore soap opera movi much potenti creat excit univers could easili made mani movi storylin like one done avatar franchis
23,Avatar: The Way of Water,Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).",serious come back watch film cinema london cannot recommend film enjoy first avatar curiou see stori would go also expect brilliant visual experi stori complet repeat first film villain visual big deal expect especi long wait sequel worst thing bore lame plot even end suck cameron tri rip titan end oh kid irrit kept say bro bro like serious give damn expect sam worthington charact still centr stori stupid kid oh get start teenag tarzan dreadlock kid noth film honestli realli believ great review must pr peopl write peopl never seen good cinema found disrespect repeat first film plot albeit differ set consid bore cringeworthi dialogu effect overr find hard believ anyon would bother give star let alon see rd instal come certainli give star expect much sequel certainli alien great sequel folk
24,Avatar: The Way of Water,"More Avatar, More Water, More Average",6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.",jame cameron give jame bond thunderbal competit mani underwat sequenc fit featur length three hour film movi alright guess retread quit bit first film feel like style substanc place pretti shot cgi get emot impact one much origin jake neytiri get way less screentim focus children secondari charact blue peopl action sure justifi runtim think could easili cut minut without problem score decent although jame horner absenc notic want avatar deliv guess expect anyth new stori littl underwhelm think
25,The Menu,"A completely bonkers and over-the-top, yet perhaps brilliant satire",8,"This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.I won't spoil anything with a synopsis, but rather try to intrigue anyone on the fence about seeing this movie.The Menu has something fresh and interesting to say about the tired conversation surrounding the marriage between art and artist. There are some very clearly illogical and confusing elements of the plot that you can easily miss if you're taking it at face value.Overall, this movie isn't meant to be a sensible, coherent and satisfying thriller. Instead, it's a comment on a poignant phenomenon in our society: the way we view, consume, pursue, and ultimately obsess over those who produce the art around us. Sure, the movie is about a chef and his meticulous menu, but in reality the larger point is about the production of any type of art, namely filmmaking.It seems to me that the filmmaker is making a very focused point about the state of movies nowadays. There seems to be a constant theme throughout about how often artist and their fans seem so detached from each other, even though their mutual approval of the art should be enough to bring them together.An absolutely bonkers second act and a considerably more bonkers third act wrap up what I believe to be a masterpiece commentary on the state of filmmaking in 2022. The only moneymakers are massive superhero movies, massive studio A++ list celebrity movies, etc, and the makers of this film ask one simple question:How long until we collectively call out their BS and ask for some simple bread?The movie makes you question how far you'd go into ""buying into the hype"", and conversely has a quite shocking commentary on those who consistently stay away from ""the hype"" without buying into it. Think of some of the ridiculous fashion trends that some of the highest brands in clothing perpetuate, and just how many people will blindly follow simply because there is an LV or GG stamp on it.It's no shock to me that a script with this kind of tonal shifting comes to us from the writers/directors of Succession. So much of the way this film is crafted reminds me of the show. Sharp wit, sarcasm that lies somewhere between funny and cringeworthy, twists, turns, and of course, the oh-so subtle thumbing of the nose at all the socially accepted, yet fundamentally insane reverence for brilliance that we hold dear.As a movie-lover, this was one of the more thought provoking pieces of the year. This movie makes you wonder what the line is between brilliant artist and insane psycho. The movie makes you look around and find yourself in the all the characters; the artist, the art, and those who are (literally) consuming it.All in all, this movie is an insightful parody of the state of not only the word of fine dining, but also fashion, art, filmmaking, music, etc. I might have a completely wrong reading of this movie, but hey, that's what art's about, right?",movi play someth everyon come across live obsess movi start seemingli eeri thriller suspens type movi weird uniqu quirk slowli devolv someth much wild obvious take far script tighter meticul craft chef menu even curmudgeon movi goer plate full one spoil anyth synopsi rather tri intrigu anyon fenc see movi menu someth fresh interest say tire convers surround marriag art artist clearli illog confus element plot easili miss take face valu overal movi meant sensibl coher satisfi thriller instead comment poignant phenomenon societi way view consum pursu ultim obsess produc art around us sure movi chef meticul menu realiti larger point product type art name filmmak seem filmmak make focus point state movi nowaday seem constant theme throughout often artist fan seem detach even though mutual approv art enough bring togeth absolut bonker second act consider bonker third act wrap believ masterpiec commentari state filmmak moneymak massiv superhero movi massiv studio list celebr movi etc maker film ask one simpl question long collect call bs ask simpl bread movi make question far go buy hype convers quit shock commentari consist stay away hype without buy think ridicul fashion trend highest brand cloth perpetu mani peopl blindli follow simpli lv gg stamp shock script kind tonal shift come us writer director success much way film craft remind show sharp wit sarcasm lie somewher funni cringeworthi twist turn cours oh subtl thumb nose social accept yet fundament insan rever brillianc hold dear movi lover one thought provok piec year movi make wonder line brilliant artist insan psycho movi make look around find charact artist art liter consum movi insight parodi state word fine dine also fashion art filmmak music etc might complet wrong read movi hey art right
26,The Menu,A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today,10,"From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger.

27,The Menu,The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.,5,"The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry.",hype menu intrigu review celebr geniu see sat theater credit began roll could say huh menu start readi vibe fish water real world charact end fanci dinner collect high societi foodi critic trailer gave expect cannib cult danger game type plot instead noth realli happen think understood menu tri convey deeper mean still came disappoint anya taylor joy rest cast gave great perform littl realli brought movi togeth mayb subvers cannib hunt expect movi brillianc menu definit tri clever whether might open interpret iron sat whole movi left want left hungri
28,The Menu,One of the most unique theater going experiences I've had in a long time,8,"This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.What set this film apart from other thriller, horrors are great performances and great writing. Every character here is well done and intelligently written. The entire cast gives great performances with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy truly being the standouts as they playoff each other very well.Each character purposely reflected a personality type that if you ever worked in service you would encounter and come to know very well. To my fellow service employees you know what I'm talking about.What really stuck with me long after the credits have rolled is the commentary this film has on society. At it's core I believe this film to be about a Chef who's long career facing multitudes of people both customers and critics has affected his passion for his art. It's here where I also believe to be the film makers commentary on what it is to be an artist in this films case a Chef. It felt to me what the film makers are saying is as artists they pour their heart and souls into their art and craft both to serve and entertain us and as consumers it's very easy to lose appreciation for that hard work and effort.But I digress, perhaps I'm over thinking things and this film is not very deep as I seem to believe it is. Nonetheless this film was quite unique, thrilling, and entertaining. It's films like these that remind me of why I go to the theater and why I fell in love with storytelling and cinema.IMDb: 8/10

I'm ok with an outlandish premise, but if you're going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they're in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next.

The Description and Pictures of the Different Dishes on screen was Great to See.3. The Anya Taylor Joy Character Reveal whilst talking to the Chef was Ok I guess.4. The Cop or Security Guy that Shows Up to Help was a Good Scene.5. I liked the Fact that the Chef Knew Exactly who everyone was and their History. Also, in the first half, he had this Charming yet Mysterious Malicious Vibe about him. That was Excellent.Problems I Have with the Movie -1. I get the Motivation for why the Chef is Doing what he is Doing to these People but it wasn't Executed with any Interest in these Characters.2. After the First Half, the Mood changed because the Characters Sort of Knew where this was heading and I didn't like that tone whatsoever, it was kind of like seriousness with a joky overtone and it didn't work for me.3. Two People do Something to themselves because of the there own Self-Disappointment and Supposed Admiration for the Chef and I thought to myself ""Really?""4. There is a pointless albeit a sort of funny to watch ""Activity"" that happens in the Movie. But it was Pointless.5. At the End, When Anya Taylor Joy gives the Chef a ""Change of Heart"", I thought it was a great idea however once again, it wasn't Executed profoundly, it was Dull.6.

Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect audience surrogate amongst a sea of deliberately unlikeable characters of which the best is Nicholas Hoult whose almost too good at making his character hilariously pathetic.Mark Mylod's direction is excellent, the film has more than enough visual style to match the pretentiousness of its characters and is really good at building tension.

There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.While the plot is pretty original (which normally scores high points with me) and while the film is at times quite beautiful to look at, it altogether missed the main point of a good meal: gratification.Scares are not included on the menu; comedic value is barely there; it is unsatisfyingly light on gore; hints of interesting dialogue exist, but they are scantily peppered throughout; the characters as well as their backstories, are as distinctly unpalatable, as are their intentions nondescript; it wore on and became progressively less, instead of more enjoyable; and the main course was both 'cheesy' and less than fulfilling.

Were well realized I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to see where it was all going.Sadly it didn't really go anywhere. It all unwound in the second half.

34,The Menu,I tried to chew but couldn't swallow,6,"""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end.

It will have you laughing while on the edge of your seat as it navigates you through a restaurant experience to remember.We are treated to a fantastic ensemble cast. Nicholas Hoult steals the show with a pitch perfect performance of a pretentious foodie. Fiennes is so wonderfully unhinged as the mysterious creator of the eponymous menu in a very layered role. Anya Taylor Joy as always is so watchable, providing such an easy way in for the audience. The writing gives them all such brilliant material which the whole cast executes with ease.The style and staging of the piece can't be faulted at all. It is precise, inventive, and so clean and polished which makes for a very visually appealing film.It must be said there are a few rough edges when it comes to the plot, and when you get down to the nuts and bolts the premise isn't necessarily groundbreaking. It is very on the nose at times and subtlety isn't exactly it's strong suit. However it manages to strike a well tuned balance between satire, comedy, and thriller which isn't an easy feat and is impressively managed here.With its sharp social observations and satire, clean style, and stellar performances, the Menu is a feast that you won't want to end.",menu real treat laugh edg seat navig restaur experi rememb treat fantast ensembl cast nichola hoult steal show pitch perfect perform pretenti foodi fienn wonder unhing mysteri creator eponym menu layer role anya taylor joy alway watchabl provid easi way audienc write give brilliant materi whole cast execut eas style stage piec fault precis invent clean polish make visual appeal film must said rough edg come plot get nut bolt premis necessarili groundbreak nose time subtleti exactli strong suit howev manag strike well tune balanc satir comedi thriller easi feat impress manag sharp social observ satir clean style stellar perform menu feast want end

But this menu lacked flavor.Problems with this movie: Nobody you cared about; why did Chef decide to do this final menu; why did everyone believe in his cause; how were these people who came that 'bad' or deserving of their fate; why would he tell at least one of them what he was planning; and what was the point of setting up a fake coast guard, how did he know that would even be needed; what was the point of having his mother there; how does the protagonist not only figure out how to start up the boat but also pilot it in the dark.The movie had good pacing, but the direction this film was going, even who would survive in the end, was way too obvious early on.

38,The Menu,A sumptuous feast for the eyes,9,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is a tasteful treat that manages to be gripping, satirical, jarring, and hauntingly brilliant. The film is a great social commentary on class values and class systems. It gives audiences an adrenaline rush that makes for an exciting and wild viewing experience. The film is filled with twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing till the credits roll. Apart from its rich screenplay and magnificent production design, the film also benefits from having a star-studded cast. Ralph Fiennes as the stern and conservative Chef Slovik is the obvious standout, but Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot aka Erin brings something different to the table (literally). Nicholas Hoult as Tyler perfectly brings this rather douchey and self-obsessed character to life. I went in completely blind, not having watched the trailer and avoided any marketing for the movie, and I'm glad that I did. Everyone should experience this movie by themselves and to not let anyone influence their opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie nabs Oscar nominations for best production design and best screenplay.

39,The Menu,"Serve me something else, please.",3,"'The Menu' received widespread acclaim, and honestly I can't fathom why. The film is just as pretentious as gourmet cooking.So, twelve guests attend an executive, very, very expensive dinner on an island. All of them were personally invited by Chef Slowik. On arrival, the maître d'hôtel Elsa noticed Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) did not bring his original date. With him is Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) who - as it turns out - was hired to accompany him. This little detail will play a big part later.The rest of the film is set almost entirely in the restaurant, as we watch the specially selected menu being served - gourmet cooking at its best. Exquisite dishes are being served, impeccably garnished to perfection. (Personally, I've never been one for gourmet food. I want FOOD, not samples thereof...)We soon realize there is something sinister about the chef. This is one of those films where saying too much will result in spoilers. All I'm going to say, is that even after a person gets killed in view of everyone, they continue serving and the guest continue to saviour their food. And even towards the end they STILL have an appetite and comment on how delicious the food is - after everything that's happened...!!!! I shook my head in disbelief thinking ""what the bloody hell is wrong with these people..."".As the film developed, it became weirder and weirder. Just weird. There were a few character twists, but as a whole the movie just wasn't entertaining. Oh, and the Tyler character was a real idiot and the most unlikeable character. Very little to nothing is told why the victims deserved their fate. This film made absolutely no sense whatsoever.Despite all the fancy trimmings, by the end all I wanted was a plain ole cheese burger (figuratively speaking, off course). I wanted something with substance, and not merely hints of something promising (hmm, just like gourmet food...)Had 'The Menu' not been given a substantial budget with a stellar cast, this could easily have ended up being a bad B-movie. By the time the film ended, it felt like a complete waste of time for this highly overrated film. 'The Menu' did not satisfy my palette. I can't recommend this.Would I watch it again? No!

40,The Menu,Absence Of A Single Likable Character (Or Over-Arching Message) May Limit The Palette Here,3,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining"" is anything but.To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu"" was that it lacked any character I could really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I couldn't find a ""way in"".I also believe that ""The Menu"" is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to see what sticks"" sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.I can give ""The Menu"" 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly care one way or another.",mark mylod menu clearli satir great mani thing class snobbish obsess eat experi gener immedi spring mind certainli get awkward laugh throw enough bizarr sight charact gag live satir monik without one coher arc messag singl charact realli root basic overview menu follow tyler nichola hoult margot anya taylor joy embark lavish expens dine experi coordin master chef slowik ralph fienn cours progress weird quickli becom deadli seriou pop up becom appar fine dine anyth glare problem menu lack charact could realli root amidst bizarr natur circumst place certainli chef pretenti passeng clearli protagonist suppos taylor joy margot even charact difficult root begin suffer themat irregular reveal difficult becom invest film find way also believ menu much throw bunch theme wall see stick sort movi number undercurr run pictur larg dangl front audienc quickli move next one overal take home messag thoroughfar found give menu star least compet product visual tonal standpoint even one accept spatter idea constitut plot may difficult find someth someon make truli care one way anoth

42,The Menu,I'd Like To Take It Back,4,"So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.The film sees a young couple who travel to a Remote Island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the Chef has prepared a lavish & interesting menu. Though as soon as they arrive there, things are not all they seem & the food the Chef brings out makes the couple & everyone else question what is really going on as a sinister feeling starts to boil...!I found the film to be not the greatest. I mean, the first half is great & suspenseful & really keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It really entices you in as there doesn't appear to be anything to make you think something obviously bad is going to happen. So, for the first half it's great, but...The second half is a let down. The film goes completely off the rails, the story itself & its narrative are as clear as mud & there's so many unanswered questions, plot holes & things that happen that go against the main antagonists rules. The ending was just bad also & just plain lazy & too straight forward for a film like this one.The action we did get, the gore & shocking violence were great, but couldn't save this dish, sadly. There's some humour to be had in this film which was good, but again, couldn't salvage this feast even if it wanted to.The film does somewhat drag & the runtime is 100 minutes too long (1 hour & 40 minutes). I also felt the narrative & story arc of the film wasn't clear enough & the ending was totally unsatisfactory. The cast, however, were great. The characters were ok, but the main female lead was pretty unlikable. Chef Slowik was good though.Overall, it's a pretty out there film. Not the greatest & has a clear as mud plot with other elements not aiding in the understanding. The characters are ok, but weak with the except of Chef Slowik, the main antagonist Margo wasn't likable & pretty obnoxious. The films story arc & ending made no sense & had 0 explanation by the final act with a dragged out pacing & runtime. While there was some funny parts & some action/gore, it couldn't save this dish that I would like to take back.4/10.",seen brief preview read briefli entir sure expect horror comedi type film reason went see film see young coupl travel remot island eat exclus restaur chef prepar lavish interest menu though soon arriv thing seem food chef bring make coupl everyon els question realli go sinist feel start boil found film greatest mean first half great suspens realli keep guess go happen next realli entic appear anyth make think someth obvious bad go happen first half great second half let film goe complet rail stori narr clear mud mani unansw question plot hole thing happen go main antagonist rule end bad also plain lazi straight forward film like one action get gore shock violenc great save dish sadli humour film good salvag feast even want film somewhat drag runtim minut long hour minut also felt narr stori arc film clear enough end total unsatisfactori cast howev great charact ok main femal lead pretti unlik chef slowik good though overal pretti film greatest clear mud plot element aid understand charact ok weak except chef slowik main antagonist margo likabl pretti obnoxi film stori arc end made sens explan final act drag pace runtim funni part action gore save dish would like take back
43,The Menu,Pointless and empty,1,"Dark humor and satire are mostly very satisfying. But in The Menu it didn't go as well as it started. The beginning is actually very good. I was completely enchanted. The cinematography and acting is stunning. But somewhere in the middle something went very wrong. So wrong that you don't understand what's going on. And that's exactly where The Menu fails. Too many awkward and crazy things happen and no one seemed to care, and that's also when I realized that The Menu is actually a very pointless and empty dark satire with no real punchline.

49,Babylon,Excess is the name of the game,8,"Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood.",whether orgi showcas variou bodili fluid plot thread runtim film damien chazel fulli unrestrain latest film la la land whiplash favorit film big fan chazel directori style show flash brillianc often throughout babylon indulg extrem tendenc well modern hollywood epic lot like open sequenc sight behold mesmer vibrant energi film chug along good pace next two hour point realli feel runtim last hour chazel lose stori bit sever instanc thought film anoth scene would pop next runtim realli feel unnecessari honestli whole plot line could cut affect film justin hurwitz compos anoth terrif score nice hint la la land photographi costum product design stellar outsid shoddi edit especi bizarr movi montag end realli gel technic aspect film quit achiev chazel realli need someon tell film better edit combin self restraint would much closer epic masterpiec statu clearli aim stand pretti entertain tale excess fame earli year hollywood
50,Babylon,Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse,8,"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out.",interest open scene main charact manni diego calva tri get eleph parti bel air babylon floor ga pedal bare come air rest run time want credit damien chazel team provid uniqu experi regard pace set tone express fever dream overus babylon captur chaotic constantli shift way kept enraptur movi look fantast even interest period cinema doubt babylon still pull costum set dynam show disorgan tumultu earli hollywood hook get go movi flaw present vibrant fast move keep help entertain babylon distinct look pace come charact thing littl familiar conrad laroy loos base coupl peopl era lesson movi want teach us hollywood chew spit talent pretti routin think babylon effect get across littl let movi start bombast quietli tip toe convention end charact meant less distinct manni audienc avatar exampl wish littl fresh want follow throughout length movi damien chazel enough name could probabl get actor actress want cast still attract big interest name babylon think everi member main cast fantast job credit chazel get perform brad pitt biggest name realli enjoy work put jack conrad appropri funni conrad lush top behaviour garner genuin sympathi world turn pitt could play big came entitl prick warmth passion conrad pitt get across alway like margot robbi point nelli throw complet surpris amount physic nuanc nelli whirlwind behaviour much like pitt realli funni given opportun despit pretti telegraph arc charact understand manni resist nelli even crystal clear bad news wrap pretti packag would hope pitt robbi get award consider work diego repres audienc wit crazi go along pretti blank slate enough diego charact distinct understand motiv want credit li jun li jovan adepo ladi fay zhu sidney palmer respect charact written heavi hand sympathet respect moment oddest cast tobey maguir threaten mobster jame mckay maguir surprisingli good creepi underworld figur get neg babylon movi indulg exact vice lambast film babylon determin show excess hedon era glori appreci moment movi get pretti gross earli scene involv eleph go shock peopl get chazel team tri show realli necessari argu babylon lengthi run time also go drive peopl away also affect stori twist turn charact start depth gradual turn gener nelli specif come mind could easili trim fat movi total length babylon feel littl self indulg previous mention frenet pace keep guess sap end impact got movi tri say wrap deni bounc seat anticip get leav like lavish insan parti babylon present choos take hit whatev poison choic dive headfirst indulg slip back babylon go incred polar film enjoy larg part movi also mani scene fell flat grade babylon somewher round moment babylon real cinemat magic comfort wholesal recommend babylon interest wolf wall street style comedi excess hollywood get pretti dark check
51,Babylon,At least an hour too long.,6,"This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance.

52,Babylon,Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie,4,"So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like.

53,Babylon,"Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!",4,"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.",main takeaway left theater even watch film far long probabl one storylin mani make movi fli instead first act drag drag drag funni thing best moment film within first hour less cohes chaotic film excit felt point though film fall apart plotlin stray film mayb crazi energi first third attempt tri regain energi final quit captur came turn debaucheri horror gel well felt like tone contradict began act hand fantast robbi pitt electr way diego calva emot without say anyth brilliant wish script direct la la land writer director damien chazel good act sometim film felt like watch four film time plotlin could movi see jumbl togeth felt self indulg exhaust end one storylin sort end make feel justifi tell afterward credit start roll sat feel wit littl three hour overal recommend peopl mind three hour runtim keep mind film plot goe absolut nowher although might fun trip time rather pointless one talk pictur
54,Babylon,I'm with the elephant!,3,"In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.Writer/director Damien Chazelle, who gave us LA LA LAND a few years ago, turns the clock back to the 1920s when ""Hollywoodland"" was transitioning from silent pictures to sound. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie play two leading actors who flounder during this period of adjustment, cast in a series of tawdry flops. Diego Calva and Jovan Adepo play a Mexican production assistant and a jazz trumpeter whose careers briefly flare. All four stars make the best of their roles despite the chaotic screenplay. Robbie's damaged character, a stock favorite, fueled by addiction to cocaine and gambling, is overdone and risks losing the viewer's sympathy.Orgiastic parties and a weird scene in a mountain torture palace presided over by Tobey Maguire in overdrive bring echoes of historic Babylon and some of the weirder extremes of early Hollywood. And there are many references to SINGING IN THE RAIN, that gem of a film set in the same era as this mash-up - one of the all-time greatest movies.

55,Babylon,Ambitious film torpedoed by weak and self-indulgent script,3,"As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, CA 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer=director Damien Chazelle. Let me admit up front that I absolutely LOVED all three of his prior movies (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", and ""First Man""). Hence I went into this film with high expectations. Alas, I shouldn't have. ""Babylon"" certainly is well done from a technical perspective (photography, editing, musical score), but it misfires badly from a substantive perspective. The storyline is supposed to show us how Hollywood's transition from silent films into talkies was a success for some and a disaster for others. But what we get to see here is a self-indulgent, unfocused, and over-long movie, torpedoed by its weak script. (Can someone please tell me what the point of the snake fight scene was? Or of the freak show towards the end of the film? And that's just naming those two). The all-star cast certainly gives its best shot with the weak material that they are given, but in the end this film cannot be saved. This is 3+ hours of my live I'm never getting back.""Babylon"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but COVID had other ideas. It was just released in US theaters this past weekend, and vastly underperformed at the box office. Let's just say it as it is: it tanked. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 10 people). I cannot imagine that Babylon will have long legs at the box office, or that it will pick up a bunch of Oscar nominations. For that the movie is simply too weak, too long and over-indulgent for its own good. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you liked Chazelle's earlier films, I'd suggest you check this out (albeit with low expectations), and draw your own expectation.",babylon releas min open bel air ca find massiv hand parti sex drug de rigueur jack conrad big movi star becom center parti upon arriv also nelli laroy beauti brash aspir actress also manuel torr hope find job movi industri point minut film coupl comment latest writer produc director damien chazel let admit front absolut love three prior movi whiplash la la land first man henc went film high expect ala babylon certainli well done technic perspect photographi edit music score misfir badli substant perspect storylin suppos show us hollywood transit silent film talki success disast other get see self indulg unfocus long movi torpedo weak script someon pleas tell point snake fight scene freak show toward end film name two star cast certainli give best shot weak materi given end film cannot save hour live never get back babylon suppos releas year ago covid idea releas us theater past weekend vastli underperform box offic let say tank tuesday earli even screen saw local arthous theater cincinnati attend okay count peopl cannot imagin babylon long leg box offic pick bunch oscar nomin movi simpli weak long indulg good cours take word like chazel earlier film suggest check albeit low expect draw expect
56,Babylon,Damien's Inferno,3,"In the words of SuperHotFire, I'm about to end Damien Chazelle's whole career.Babylon is a preposterously bad movie. At the same it's an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life. It's aggressively vile. For the vast majority of three hours, you are locked in with this movie as it assaults you with graphic visual depictions of virtually every bodily function imaginable. Supposedly, this is a commentary on the evil, exploitative and corrupt studio system that destroyed old Hollywood. Damien Chazelle, having started his career planting a sloppy wet kiss on the industry with the maudlin, yet beautifully constructed La La Land comes back 6 years later with a film filled with nothing but hatred and anger. But at the same time, that's still not what Babylon wants to be. It wants to be an unforgettable epic. Chazelle wants to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese and P. T. Anderson. He wanted to make a film that sweepingly celebrates the beauty and horror of an American artistic movement. He's so emotionally invested as a Hollywood man that its driven him completely insane. Not since Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate has such a psychotic Hollywood movie been made. If it had just been a Molotov cocktail thrown at Hollywood, and nothing more, Babylon could have been a stroke of genius. Instead, it is so gluttonously self-indulgent and conceptually unstable, that I've lost any kind of respect that I may have had for Chazelle as a director before.Now let's take a step back. Are there any redeeming qualities about Babylon? Yes. Two scenes in particular showcase the immense skill that Chazelle still has as a director and offer glimpses of the kind of good movie Babylon could have been. The scene that details the grueling creation of the first talking movie is both hilarious and exhilarating in showing how impossible it was to work with the new technology. When the film points to the lengths at which Hollywood executives exploited their new silver screen stars through their race and gender, it offers a stunningly profound depiction of the emotional abuse that was inflicted on the actors. But all of that is buried under an avalanche of sophomoric pornography. When the characters aren't cursing like truck drivers, they are having ravenous sex or projectile vomiting, or urinating on each other. This film wants to be The Wolf of Wall Street, Boogie Nights and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas all at the same time. But it's none of those films. It is instead a fascinating race to the bottom. I can't say that I wasn't entertained by the experience. I was wildly amused by it, in fact. But I also felt dirty as I walked out of the theater seeing this. Only see this film if you are with an audience of people who are blacked-out drunk or so high that they cover the screen with pot smoke. I'd assume that would be a blast of an experience.",word superhotfir end damien chazel whole career babylon preposter bad movi experi rememb rest life aggress vile vast major three hour lock movi assault graphic visual depict virtual everi bodili function imagin supposedli commentari evil exploit corrupt studio system destroy old hollywood damien chazel start career plant sloppi wet kiss industri maudlin yet beauti construct la la land come back year later film fill noth hatr anger time still babylon want want unforgett epic chazel want mention breath scorses p anderson want make film sweepingli celebr beauti horror american artist movement emot invest hollywood man driven complet insan sinc michael cimino heaven gate psychot hollywood movi made molotov cocktail thrown hollywood noth babylon could stroke geniu instead glutton self indulg conceptu unstabl lost kind respect may chazel director let take step back redeem qualiti babylon ye two scene particular showcas immens skill chazel still director offer glimps kind good movi babylon could scene detail gruel creation first talk movi hilari exhilar show imposs work new technolog film point length hollywood execut exploit new silver screen star race gender offer stunningli profound depict emot abus inflict actor buri avalanch sophomor pornographi charact curs like truck driver raven sex projectil vomit urin film want wolf wall street boogi night fear loath la vega time none film instead fascin race bottom say entertain experi wildli amus fact also felt dirti walk theater see see film audienc peopl black drunk high cover screen pot smoke assum would blast experi
57,Babylon,An indulgent mess with surprisingly little to say,4,"Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" isn't one of them. 4/10.",given whiplash la la land outstand film seem reason hope expect director damien chazel new film would deliv seem uniqu spectacl excess debaucheri hollywood would combin flashi hope given chazel previou track record compel stori profound charact develop tragic howev babylon bloat misfir end uniqu wrong reason right bat chazel bring viewer along ride end fusillad puls pound jazz music whirlwind hedon increasingli sophomor eye roll moment would fine coher stori contextu justif indulg ala except well direct film scorses goodfella even wolf wall street paul thoma anderson boogi night complet wrap around crackerjack virtuoso sens intens simultan complement narr unfortun babylon debaucheri start get increasingli tire charact thinli written especi chazel standard uninterest contrast better film excess keep viewer wholli engag long runtim film plot pretti loos unengag gargantuan minut runtim help matter much either perform fine unexcept yet even talent actor cast elev disappoint sometim pointless screenwrit given work result movi feel far less satisfi impact especi sinc mani move part realli add anyth even film messag magic cinema come bit hollow given mani far better film dealt topic hope chazel next film stronger one someth eagerli await given previou work certainli clearli qualifi make great film unfortun babylon one
58,Babylon,"A big, bloated, shapeless mess, filled with lazy caricatures",4,"I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera.

59,Babylon,Margot is all in!,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.Writer-director Damien Chazelle (Oscar winner, LA LA LAND, 2016) sets the stage for his wild and frenzied epic meant (I think) as a tribute to early Hollywood and the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies. Of course, that topic has been handled in other prestige films - recently with THE ARTIST (2011), as well as the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952). It's the latter which serves as a template or guidepost for Chazelle, to such an extent that he shows clips from it, quotes it, and even has a couple of his characters share similarities with Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood.From the moment she crashes onto the party scene, this becomes Margot Robbie's movie. Fully engaged doesn't begin to describe how she embodies the Nellie LaRoy character. Nellie is a displaced Jersey girl desperate to break into showbiz, and she pursues stardom with everything she has to offer. Nellie is a risk-taker and literal gambler, and the character is supposedly inspired by the infamous Clara Bow. It's at that first wild party where she meets both Jack Conrad (Oscar winner Brad Pitt) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva). Conrad is a huge silent movie star, and also a boozing womanizer with the accompanying swagger (supposedly based on actor John Gilbert). Manny, though a much quieter soul, is much like Nellie in that his ambition is to work in the movie business. The two discuss their dreams while tearing into mounds of cocaine.Nellie's fearlessness in front of the camera (much like Ms. Robbie's) pays off as the offers roll in and she makes her name. She and Manny periodically cross paths as he climbs the ladder towards studio executive. We also keep up with Jack Conrad and his stream of wives, and how things begin to change with THE JAZZ SINGER and the advent of talking motion pictures. While all this is happening, the film also (sorta) follows the career of jazz trumpeter Sidney Powell (Jovan Adepo) as he builds a career as a black performer on screen. One of the more interesting characters who we wish had more screen time is Lady Fay (played by Li Jun Li). We are rarely treated to a Chinese lesbian chanteuse, and she makes each of her scenes quite fascinating.Others in the cast include Olivia Wilde as one of Jack Conrad's many wives, Lukas Haas as an industry guy, Eric Roberts as Nellie's hustler dad, Pat Skipper as William Randolph Hearst, and Max Minghella as the legendary Irving Thalberg. They are each fine, but none as memorable as Tobey Maguire (also a producer on the film), who has a funny/creepy cameo as a fictional giggling gangster named James McKay. However, it's Jean Smart as Elinor St John, a gossip columnist in the mold of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who has the film's best scene when she deals the hard truth to Jack Conrad. Ms. Smart seems to excel in every role she takes these days, and this may be one of her best, albeit with limited screen time.The issues with the film have nothing to do with its entertainment value and outrageous moments or with the performances. Each of those things keep us watching. It's only when we stop and think about it when the problems come into focus. Most blatant is the love story between Manny and Nellie. They actually spend very little time together after their cocaine feast. Certainly not enough to fall in love. There is a 'blackface' scene unlike anything you've seen before, and in 3 hours and 8 minutes director Chazelle follows up the projectile elephant poop with vomit from a drug overdose, vomit from something other than a drug overdose, a urine stream, and rattlesnake venom. At times it seems like he wanted to see just how much he could get away with.Chazelle collaborators from LA LA LAND include cinematographer Linus Sandgren composer Justin Hurwitz, and Film Editor Tom Cross, all three are Oscar winners from that film, and all provide superb work here. The technical aspects of the film are terrific, it's as a story (or stories) where things unravel. It's simply bloated and overly ambitious, while having some of the frenetic pacing of Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE! Or THE GREAT GATSBY. It appears filmmaker Chazelle is attempting to reinforce cinema is art as a spectacle, when most of us don't require more proof. The movie montage at the end is fun to watch, but strikes this viewer as a bit indulgent after a long movie.

60,Babylon,"A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema",8,"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10.",babylon track career manni torr aspir filmmak mexico cross path fellow aspir starlet nelli laroy bacchanalian parti one night lo angel film also follow sever charact parti includ movi star jack conrad cabaret perform fay zhu tabloid journalist elinor st john musician sidney palmer rise fall respect career span end silent film begin sound product charact cross path throughout navig shift busi hollywood larg scale epic damien chazel word ambiti scope mere technic open utterli ravish debaucher parti sequenc captur madden spirit roar twenti hollywood set visual bar fairli high number fantast sequenc throughout film key parti sequenc charact introduc first interven without doubt highlight film charact fiction screenplay blend pass name real life histor hollywood figur well thinli veil refer other firstli almost goe without say babylon gorgeous photograph perform also uniformli solid diego calva likabl presenc centerpiec charact margot robbi portray brash troubl jersey girl fli seat pant comic poignant turn brad pitt fittingli play drunken goodheart movi star jean smart also welcom presenc curt astut gossip columnist ostens base louella parson writer ilk film conscious top mani point captur madcap spirit someth late ken russel would direct first three quarter particularli outstand demonstr realiti technic transit silent film motion pictur talki pose legitim career alter often career destroy challeng nearli everyon part busi chazel project theme audienc one memor protract sequenc robbi charact along sound man struggl fail interrupt struggl perform simpl one page scene nut bolt logist challeng fledgl industri perhap intrigu compon stori highlight vastli differ arduou process make sound pictur actor filmmak accustom establish way time reach final act howev viewer get sens project begin implod weight degre focu certain charact ebb flow film begin lose steam reviv somewhat insan sequenc torr anoth crew member film studio attempt save laroy reckless gambl decis cross path eccentr crime boss play tobey maguir journey subterranean gather place citi debaucher denizen liter gone underground follow reserv moral code garish ghoulish sequenc feel like tour dant inferno probabl quit intent almost madcap open parti sequenc film grind somewhat abrupt halt charact live career face signific devast last thirti minut sens tragedi one might expect feel strang absent perhap charact larger life even cartoonish time still felt emot core miss stori resolv film end profoundli cynic note show hollywood place metaphor devour constantli replenish unend stream make pilgrimag seek etch mark tapestri cinema observ astut implic splash across screen centuri span montag snippet earliest film contemporari one babylon mani strong point mainli visual sturdi perform focu industri realiti earli filmmak st centuri viewer would take grant eventu grow bit long tooth third hour lose tenac enough film entir collaps though come close noth els earn keep ambiti scabrou love hate letter cinema
61,Babylon,desperately trying too hard,6,"It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far. I do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work.",hollywood silent movi era parti epic debaucheri manni torr diego calva mexican fixer servant dirti job jack conrad brad pitt big movi star nelli laroy margot robbi flamboy nobodi fake make make silent era end everybodi work master new sound era appeal start know happen everi oscar bait movi insist overli broad comed scene bodili function eleph complet overboard open scene indic come movi desper tri hard guess suppos root margot robbi find abras alway appeal find tragic heartbreak help charact would work better concentr brad pitt charact best heart felt scene climax manni torr probabl main charact big charact arc like charact perform stoic need differ perform besid brad pitt charact arc love gener premis redo singin rain great premis need littl foreshadow less outrag could simpl modern day reviv admir fan watch singin rain open movi damien chazel tri hard hit fals note whole enterpris stumbl alway get back compel scene exampl first sound shot fun like end damien keep push comedi one step far appreci overal premis ambit work
62,Babylon,Decadence,7,"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.",babylon long messi repuls magnet spectacl unfortun despit great perform set piec live chazel previou work movi want bring wast yard hollywood pull see beauti grow trash problem movi spend much time mud goe deep time tri pull end late upsid cast great almost complet carri movi especi margot robbi enthral perform nelli chazel previou work set piec well execut charact memor howev posit could complet overcom movi fundament flaw go far tri revolt audienc point childish spend enough time charact import scene despit decad runtim end come complet pretenti context practic cynic everyth lead end babylon serv purpos entertain spectacl like hollywood critiqu self indulg prevent achiev great
63,Babylon,A cinematic experience,10,"Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever.",babylon cinemat marvel damien chazel messi dazzl epic masterpiec film yet accept damien chazel call babylon hate letter hollywood love letter movi messi dazzl epic support simplist idea set earli day cinema talk pictur jaw drop phenomenon hollywood still creat babylon suggest deeper realiti film industri raw self destruct narcissist impuls gloriou magic result alway opposit part whole chazel ambit huge babylon full remark set piec richli drawn charact music danc love betray film strength make seriou flaw includ mani end wrong head relianc singin rain touchston babylon make groan occasion mani time long exhilar stretch mesmeris one film multipl end leap ahead major charact sit cinema tear watch singin rain enamour movi scene fresh sinc sullivan travel mention cinema paradiso year empir light fact scene view homag film make less clich montag movi histori bravura needless coda best chazel film cinemat marvel evid enough movi magic sweep us beauti terribl world recognis hollywood even cast babylon amaz almost eerili sync tast actor deepli love like taylor nichol ethan suple show oh briefli cast director francin maisler thumb mental rolodex said ah anoth face sonni would like see perhap anoth reason found drawn babylon excess like spend time almost everyon big beauti screen fell love cast stori believ babylon thu miss last minut fit almost serendipit way end movi audienc come go ephemer ever chang name marque darken theater fill flicker light etern everlast deathless actor audienc alik come go show goe forev

68,Babylon,"Outstanding, multi-genre mash up with many jaw dropping moments.",9,"Damian Chazelle doesn't make bad movies (whiplash, La La Land, First Man) but much of what I'd heard about Babylon in advance of seeing (no experiencing) it for myself was less than complimentary.Turgid, overlong, rambling, too strident and lacking a narrative.Well, in my view, all of those criticisms are both unfounded and unfair, because Babylon is magnificent.It's an epic story spanning thirty years, beginning in the silent era when Hollywood was in its most outrageous Klondike era.The talkies would pivot the narrative when Al Jolson's Jazz Singer arrived, but for now anything went and that's where the movie begins in a lavish set piece piece that starts with a scatalogical Elephant episode and culminates, some 25 minutes late, in a drug fuelled frenzy at the end of all parties.Then up comes the title credit, fully 25 minutes in.It's jaw dropping and hilarious.We then see the, also hilarious, growth of silent cinema where anyone with a mind, and a budget to do it, can do it. This is where Brad Pitt (a matinee idol in his final years) and Margot Robbie (a wannabe with talent and gumption) dominate proceedings with Robbie putting in a career high performance.In the third act the story slows down considerably and assumes a narrative direction before all hell breaks loose in the penultimate chapter (it turns into a horror film, with a stand out cameo from Toby MaGuire, that morphs into a psychedelic episode that Kubrick would have loved, before reaching its Jazzy musical finale.It's three hours of endless ideas, superb styling, sets and costume design.In using Singing In the Rain as a central plot device, and theme for the movie's funniest sequence on an early sound stage, Chazelle treats us to his first real exploration of humour.It's an homage, as the whole movie is, to the greatest days of hollywood. It's a comedy, a romance, a horror and a musical all rolled into one.And the music. On my, fans of La La Land will enjoy the musical themes that run throughout and are a direct follow up to his first masterpiece.I applauded the movie as the final curtain came down. It contains more ideas, more vitality, more chutzpah than anything I've seen for ages and I for one hope to see it rewarded at the Hollywood gongs night in the spring.Bravo.",damian chazel make bad movi whiplash la la land first man much heard babylon advanc see experienc less complimentari turgid overlong rambl strident lack narr well view critic unfound unfair babylon magnific epic stori span thirti year begin silent era hollywood outrag klondik era talki would pivot narr al jolson jazz singer arriv anyth went movi begin lavish set piec piec start scatalog eleph episod culmin minut late drug fuell frenzi end parti come titl credit fulli minut jaw drop hilari see also hilari growth silent cinema anyon mind budget brad pitt matine idol final year margot robbi wannab talent gumption domin proceed robbi put career high perform third act stori slow consider assum narr direct hell break loos penultim chapter turn horror film stand cameo tobi maguir morph psychedel episod kubrick would love reach jazzi music final three hour endless idea superb style set costum design use sing rain central plot devic theme movi funniest sequenc earli sound stage chazel treat us first real explor humour homag whole movi greatest day hollywood comedi romanc horror music roll one music fan la la land enjoy music theme run throughout direct follow first masterpiec applaud movi final curtain came contain idea vital chutzpah anyth seen age one hope see reward hollywood gong night spring bravo

Chazelle has created a movie that is a love letter to Hollywood not because of depraved parties or preventing talented minorities from becoming stars but from reflecting how far Hollywood has become.I was amazed by the Oscar-worthy performances from Margot Robbie. She is fantastic and deserves a nomination. Brad Pitt is excellent as well, and the newcomer Mexican actor Diego Calva wow, perfectly carried the whole movie; he had great chemistry with Robbie. Jean Smart was fantastic, specifically the cameo with Brad Pitt, and Tobey Maguire was hilarious. Three hours of such a spectacle from beginning to end. I loved the cinematography, and the musical score is out of this world. You feel you want to dance and sing. The story was great and nostalgic. Come on, people, I can see it was harsh for some prunes not to like the movie because of the sex and drug content, but it is far from being the objective.I loved the cameos of the movie sets that show the evolution from silent to talkies. If you love movies as much as I do, you will love Babylon, and finally, I want to tell you that the ending is epic; I don't want to spoil telling you about it.

In a certain moment I thought it was badly done on purpose as they wanted to do it as in 30s. Like Ed Wood movie.

72,Babylon,I thought it was great!,8,"Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.Babylon had an impressive ensemble cast lead by Margot Robbie. There were a few stories going through the movie and they intertwined really well. Never a dull moment at all, and thanks to the ensemble cast we got to touch on a lot of subjects that was Old School Hollywood. Socialism, racism, ageism, sexism. An all across the broad look just showing you how it wasAnd speaking of never a dull moment, going into this, I thought this movie was just going to be about a Hollywood party (technically, you can say the movie is about keeping the party going). The movie is long but it worth it because those scenes where they showed you how Hollywood Partied almost 100 years ago. You could never get away with that kind of epicness now.Plus, it was a visually stunning film too.

73,Babylon,A good and a bad movie in one,5,"The Good,
Great character from Brad Pitt, adding depth and nuance to his character.The arc of something exciting meeting it's peak and declining., and the loss and aftermath of that.Some interesting and fun scenes telling some folklore stories from the period. Of note the multiple shoots happening on the one film lot and the lengths they had to go to to get the shot, including running to get a new camera (the 2708 or 2709?), and the legendary operations and safety standards lawless zone of time culminating in the perfect sunset and the perfect single tear scene. Also the first sound shoot with the camera in the hot box and the very demanding requirements of sound recording and hitting your marks. Both of those were great scenes using folk law and history to make an interesting and watchable scene.The right place right time concept with people just chancing the be there for things to happen, being in at the start and having the verve to get up and do stuff. Especially evident for Diego Calva's character Manny.The bad.Childish and puerile details and setup too many to mention just destroyed all the good will and good work of the actors. We get it, it was hedonistic, and the writer director wants to be edgy, but so many of these scenes were misjudged, mismanaged and ultimately hurt the film for their inclusion. Does director Damien Chazelle not have a friend to tell him, ""nah, don't do that, that's not a good idea"". There must be quite a few yesmen and crew to go along with some of the more revolting and unnecessary and more importantly un-entertaining moments. (elephant, posh dinner puking, much of the opening party watersports etc etc). Why did anyone thing that stuff would add to or help make a good movie.So bloated. If you chopped out the childish puerile stuff that would only half sort the length. Just too many unnecessary story lines wedged in. The Sidney Palmer story line had almost no impact on the main story. It contributed very little to the overall effect and just repeated the same theme of movies ask you to sell your soul then spit you out thing. So too the Lady Fay Zhu story. Maybe they needed a different movie to tell their arcs but their inclusion really really bulked up the movie to a point where it dragged. It was way too long, and became a chore to get through.The over sentimental rose tinted glasses hollywood loving itself and telling us what a great and important thing they have done and given to society, and how important they are and how reverential we should be of their noble sacrifice is and the torment they have to suffer with great wealth and fame, all in the packaging of an excessive expensive modern day film. Give us a break will you. It all rang incredibly hollow and ugly and did the opposite of making us love those loveable rascals actors directors and film makers in general. I really disliked the noble industry by the end of this movie, and partially because of the film that was trying to tell their story. It highlight what is so very very wrong with Hollywood. The privilege of our attention is so often wasted on the undeserving. Damien Chazelle abused that privilege with the finished movie he delivered.

74,You People,The racism actually got on my nerves...,6,"The black side actually aggravated me more than anything. I'm black and I was almost embarrassed. They just seem incredibly racist! For all that Jonah Hill's character tried to do, it just seems as if they couldn't acknowledge it. They didn't care. He was white and that was the problem. At one point I almost wanted to scream at the screen. As for the white family, or side of the family, they're ignorance, to me, was them just trying to make the girl feel welcomed, in their own misguided way. There were times when this movie actually became a tad bit painful to watch. I know they're supposed to be a moral to this, but this movie almost promoted racism. They, in my opinion, wanted to turn the white mom interest a ""Karen"" unfairly. I actually felt bad for her because she didn't realize what she was doing and it was brought to her attention in a horrible way. Also, I think Jonah Hill's character was much stronger than Lauren London's character, Amira.Also, side note! It annoyed me that Eddie Murphy said the ""N"" word in every other sentence in this movie but took issue with white people.

And those that failed to direct the all-star cast properly, so they all ended up being unconvincing in everything they did and said.I've seen failed SNL sketches with better execution, more urgency in the acting, with coherent and cohesive dialogue. But instead, those people gave us a long, dragged out, boring and shallow blah-blah commentary, with zero laughs, that will have you struggle to stay awake in this predictable sloth-paced nonsense.Such a waste of a talented cast. This is one of those films that is more annoying than entertaining, and aside from the predictable romance as the core of the film, everything else is just forced, feels phony, and flops from every angle.

Eddie Murphy suddenly just decides to stop being a racist piece of crap and Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an awakening about how to speak to black people normally.

I supposed someone thought this was funny, but it is not. The attempts at humor fall very flat. The jokes are not funny. The cast looks bored.

Clearly she recently had a facelift.Now what I don't like about this film: as other reviewers have said, this movie was trying to be both a comedy and a social commentary. But neither one of them worked. And then we have the usual stereotypes: all Black people are angry about their oppression and aren't afraid to tell the world about it. The Black people are streetsmart and intelligent. But then we have the white people. They are all clueless, racist, and guilt ridden. Every word out of their mouths is racist and of course they don't even know that it is. This is really getting old. Why can't we just have a movie with white people and Black people being normal human beings.

Like a black Moslem would never use n-gga to address a black person or anyone else actually. This is exactly the kind of behavior they're against. I could take satire but this is out of this world. Eddie Murphy looks so out of it in this movie, like he couldn't wait for the whole thing to be over. I guess he's in it because he thinks he has to stay relevant. Also the production of the movie itself is lame. There's no artistry to it whatsoever.

84,You People,Cringeworthy,2,"You People is so poorly written and 'unintentionally' racist that you'd think it was written by Michael Scott. The entire movie is basically an amalgamation of the worst stereotypes around black, 'muslim' (I use air quotes because the characters are actually NOI members the movie misleadingly portrays as muslim), and jewish people despite its message purportedly being the opposite. Actually, I'm not entirely sure what their message was supposed to be but to me it basically came off as promoting segregation.This movie is pretty much a symbol of everything wrong with post-2015 Hollywood social commentaries... it's almost like twitter addiction has melted the mind of every writer in LA. It got so bad at points that I started to wonder if it was a conservative strawman/parody of urban progressives.Beyond that the jokes/culture references are mostly 10 years out of date and unfunny, the soundtrack rarely aligns with the scenes it plays over, the transitions between scenes look straight out of a mid 2000's disney channel show, and I'm not sure what possessed the creators to cast Jonah Hill of all people as a 'likable' lead in a romantic comedy -- it just doesn't work.",peopl poorli written unintent racist think written michael scott entir movi basic amalgam worst stereotyp around black muslim use air quot charact actual noi member movi misleadingli portray muslim jewish peopl despit messag purportedli opposit actual entir sure messag suppos basic came promot segreg movi pretti much symbol everyth wrong post hollywood social commentari almost like twitter addict melt mind everi writer la got bad point start wonder conserv strawman parodi urban progress beyond joke cultur refer mostli year date unfunni soundtrack rare align scene play transit scene look straight mid disney channel show sure possess creator cast jonah hill peopl likabl lead romant comedi work

86,You People,"Tries to be a modern update on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, but ends up as a mediocre R-rated remake of Guess Who?",5,"Ezra Cohen (Jonah Hill) is a stockbroker who also runs a podcast with his best friend, Mo (Sam Jay), where the two discuss various facets of black culture (or ""the culture"" as Ezra calls it). Ezra is under pressure from his Jewish family particularly his mother Shelley (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find a woman but Ezra has a streak of bad luck with his family's setups. Meanwhile costume designer Amira Mohammed (Lauren London) is also dealing with pressure from her opinionated father Akbar (Eddie Murphy) a devout Black Muslim. When Ezra and Amira have a chance encounter they eventually start a relationship until after some time Ezra intends to propose to Amira, but the two's families prove to be a massive obstacle.You People is a new romantic comedy directed and co-written by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and co-written and starring Jonah Hill. The movie features an impressive cast with the likes of Jonah Hill, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Nia Long, and Deavid Duchovny among several others, and from the marketing you'd probably expect a modern update the framework established by Guess Who's Coming to Dinner with its potentially rich premise of a Jewish family and Black Muslim family creating friction with one another over an incoming wedding, unfortunately while You People has a potentially rich and provocative setup, its payoff feels like a tired rehash of the Fockers films or 2005's Guess Who? With little more brought to the table than an R-rating.On a positive note, I will say that Hill and London have decent chemistry in their scenes together and on occasion there is an awkward laugh to be taken from individual exchanges in the film, but for the most part the movie doesn't feel like it has a developed cast of characters with most of the talented expanded cast playing very broad one note at best or are given the short shrift at worst. Poor David Duchovny is saddle with a terrible running gag about him going on shpiel's about Xzibit and Elliott Gould is given one line and spends most his presence in the background doing nothing most of the time. Eddie Murphy is also saddled with a role that doesn't play to his strengths as Akbar is a very serious and stoic man who isn't funny or interesting because he's been force to subdue his charisma and he really only comes to life in the role in the last 10 minutes. A large chunk of the movie is an endless parade of scenes where either Ezra or his parents make fools of themselves giving rambling unsolicited commentary on race relations and there's very few scenes where people talk like human beings and these segments are just variations on the same point repeatedly. The movie is also way too long at just under two hours and it feels its length.You People had a lot of promise as a comedy, but it just does not work at all and most of the best scenes are in the trailer with the rest of the movie an overlong slog that struggles to keep itself going. Sometimes the cast do get a mild snicker from certain exchanges, but not really enough to justify a viewing. Maybe if someone like Jerrod Carmichael had tapped into this kind of material (see On the Count of Three or The Carmichael Show for proof) then maybe something of substance could've been done with it, but as is, it's a mediocre comedy that feels like 2005's Guess Who?

It's even more difficult when the viewer doesn't belong to any of the 4 cultures on display. And as if that were not enough, it's even more difficult when the tone of the film is a comedy that tries to speak supposed truths through the comic voice of Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy.Everyone's speech feels forced, exaggerated and awkward and I think only the latter was intended. I find it one of the most uncomfortable movies to watch, but not only because of the cultural collision, but also because the characters were real idiots, including the leading couple. Everything would have been easier if they were in charge of the wedding themselves to avoid all the chaos generated by decisions that were made by people who were never supposed to have made them. Although without this, we would not have a movie either.Now, it's not all bad. I like the aesthetics of the film, I like the cultural niche in which it's inserted, I like the directorial work behind the shots.

90,You People,Awful !!! Just boring !!!,1,"So far, the worst movie I´ve seen this year. After 10 minutes I wanted to stop watching. A lot of moronic and unnecessary cursing.It has a great cast but even with that, the writing is just awful. I never laughed. Not even once!!!Watching paint dry is way more exciting than watching this snoozefest.It is unfortunate that there are no good comedies anymore. Nowaday´s movies are about sci-fi (mostly super heroes), horror and drama. No wonder why many people are so depressed. Good movies and good music are sadly a thing from the past now.I rather watch reruns of Eddie Murphy´s 80s films and his 80s stand ups Delirious and Raw and reruns of Seinfeld (with Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as Elaine) and The X-Files (With David Duchovny as FBI Agent Mulder).",far worst movi seen year minut want stop watch lot moron unnecessari curs great cast even write aw never laugh even watch paint dri way excit watch snoozefest unfortun good comedi anymor nowaday movi sci fi mostli super hero horror drama wonder mani peopl depress good movi good music sadli thing past rather watch rerun eddi murphi film stand up deliri raw rerun seinfeld julia loui dreyfuss elain x file david duchovni fbi agent mulder

For me he still has the stigma that I'm gonna get some good laughs if he does this movie. Jonah Hill is in this movie. I think Jonah Hill is funny. He has the perfect wit for Eddie to bounce jokes off of. I also saw in the trailer Nia Long is in it and I felt she was a fine enough actress for Eddie to bounce jokes off of.None of that happened. Julia Louis Dreyfuss and David Duchovny are also in the movie and they were ready to make us laugh and they did but it was so minimal. Can't say I did not laugh but I was hoping this cast would give me far more than they did.There was a point in which comedian Mike Epps, who gave me bigger laughs than Murphy, were doing a scene together and I got nothing.Comedian Andrew Schulz was in the movie, involved in a scene that had me giggling when I should have been busting a gut.All I can say is Kenya Burris hit the motherload with Blackish and the universeish (I don't know if that's what it's called), but he can't replicate it. BlackAF was a very bad replication of Blackish and You People also seems to take elements Burris touched on before, (which is not a bad thing, do what you know) but somehow it just never matches the Gold he did with Blackish.His comedy on mixed relations is getting tired, You People felt tired, and it seemed that all Eddie was doing was playing Kenya Burris and that's not what this movie needed.Not as bad as I am making it out to be but all I see is something that could have been so much better.",surpris guess know movi eddi murphi still stigma gonna get good laugh movi jonah hill movi think jonah hill funni perfect wit eddi bounc joke also saw trailer nia long felt fine enough actress eddi bounc joke none happen julia loui dreyfuss david duchovni also movi readi make us laugh minim say laugh hope cast would give far point comedian mike epp gave bigger laugh murphi scene togeth got noth comedian andrew schulz movi involv scene giggl bust gut say kenya burri hit motherload blackish universeish know call replic blackaf bad replic blackish peopl also seem take element burri touch bad thing know somehow never match gold blackish comedi mix relat get tire peopl felt tire seem eddi play kenya burri movi need bad make see someth could much better

99,Knock at the Cabin,"This movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have",6,"Knock at the Cabin (2023) is a new M. Night Shyamalan picture my wife and I caught at an A24 Advance Screening last night. The storyline follows two men and their daughter on vacation at a cabin in the woods. They are visited and captured by four individuals who come out of the woods with an ultimatum...one of the three must die at the hands of the other two or the world will end. As time runs down the family sees the death and destruction the visitors promised. Will the family let everyone die, will they save the world or is it all an elaborate game being played by four psychopaths?As previously referenced, this picture is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Rupert Grint (Harry Potter), Ben Aldridge (Our Girl), Nikki Amuka-Bird (Jupiter Ascending), Jonathan Groff (The Matrix: Resurrection) and Abby Quinn (After the Wedding).The storyline and characters in this picture had a lot of potential; but unfortunately, every situation is straightforward and predictable, all the way to the final scene. It's too bad because the cinematography and camera angles are very good and Dave Bautista delivers an outstanding performance. His character was easily my favorite. However, the characters backstories needed to be more developed, more like The Stand, before they all met at the cabin. I didn't really care what happened to those characters (the decisions were too easy to make for the family). The kill scenes themselves needed more gore and intensity. They definitely could have been better executed to highlight the situation the parents were in. The conclusion is straightforward and you know what's going to happen and how.Unfortunately, this movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have.

100,Knock at the Cabin,You already know the ending,6,"The worst part of this for me was that the ending only feels satisfying if you truly believed that the four horsemen were lying, which I rarely did. And because of that, the non-twist of exactly what they said would happen happening is a wet-blanket on a movie I kept thinking would have that twist at the end that made it all worth watching, but it never did. The twist was there was no twist. I didn't enjoy that. This movie tells you exactly what will happen from the start and that's that, so as long as you trust what they say, the film has zero impact whatsoever. The only reason this gets a 6 from me is the writing in the first 2/3 of the movie. The last third was pretty abysmal.",worst part end feel satisfi truli believ four horsemen lie rare non twist exactli said would happen happen wet blanket movi kept think would twist end made worth watch never twist twist enjoy movi tell exactli happen start long trust say film zero impact whatsoev reason get write first movi last third pretti abysm

The Cabin At the End of the World was a great book that really dives into the histories of the characters, the philosophy behind the choice, and it ended with an ambiguous ending, where you weren't sure who was right at the end.The movie was on par with The Last Airbender in how it took the source material and made a Wikipedia summary adaptation with poor dialogue, acting and an ending that missed the point. The only redeeming quality was Dave Bautista's performance. He really did a good job with the role of a giant with a heart of gold, who is forced to do something horrible. You can really see the sadness in his eyes, and his conviction that what he saw was true.M. Night needs to get help with his scripts.

102,Knock at the Cabin,"Knock, Knock at the Cabin. Who's There? Strangers Telling You It's the End of the World. No, Thank You, We Don't Want Any!",5,"Okay, Streamers, I know we all have been waiting on pins and needles for M. Night Shyamalan's next feature film, and it's finally here. Oh, was that only me? Okay, then... Anway, I was anticipating Knock at the Cabin since I saw the first trailer last fall. Home invasion and the end of the world movies build on reasonable fears that many people have, so let's see what Shyamalan was able to do with the mix of these two.Knock at the Cabin is based on a novel by Paul Tremblay, ""The Cabin at the End of the World."" Shyamalan and his co-writers have adapted that novel into this movie. The basic premise is that a gay couple and their adopted daughter are on a vacation in a remote cabin in Pennsylvania when four strangers come to the cabin and tell them that the world will end unless they decide to sacrifice one of their own. It's a moral dilemma - kill someone you love in order to save billions of people you don't even know. What would you do if these hijinks ensue.Here's the thing - the premise of this movie is very interesting. It immediately makes the audience question what decision they would make and what questions they would ask if put in this situation. In that way, the movie easily grabs you. The problem is that Shyamalan doesn't do much more than pose the question and go through the motions of telling you what these guys do. It gets repetitive and there isn't enough development of the gay couple as characters to help the audience care about them or why they make the decisions they make. Therefore, the movie becomes pretty frustrating and unsatisfying.On the other hand, there are some good aspects. Dave Bautista, who plays one of the strangers, Leonard, is an inviting presence on screen. He can be menacing by his sheer size, but his performance ably fights against first impressions. Rupert Grint, who play another stranger, Redmond, brings a bit of dark humor. He's probably the scariest of the strangers. I'll also mention that even though I don't believe they are well-developed characters, Ben Aldridge and Jonathan Groff, who play the gay couple, Eric and Andrew, have good chemistry and react appropriately in this situation. I'll also say that no one does anything really dumb in this movie, which typically happens in these home invasion movies. Eric and Andrew, generally, make smart decisions to help protect each other and their daughter. So, the movie isn't frustrating because anyone is dumb.I also don't know why this movie is rated R. There isn't really any gore. There isn't anything visually scary about it. There may be some curse words, but I can't imagine they were enough to justify this not being PG-13.In conclusion, Knock at the Cabin is a decent entry in the Shyamalan filmography. It is not one of his best, but it also certainly not one of the worst. There is a good premise, but the movie doesn't do anything more than present it as a morality play, which eventually becomes repetitive. Although there are good performances, there isn't enough character development to sustain interest in these individuals. Knock at the Cabin is only good enough for a handful of popcorn - there's no urgency to see this in a theater.",okay streamer know wait pin needl night shyamalan next featur film final oh okay anway anticip knock cabin sinc saw first trailer last fall home invas end world movi build reason fear mani peopl let see shyamalan abl mix two knock cabin base novel paul tremblay cabin end world shyamalan co writer adapt novel movi basic premis gay coupl adopt daughter vacat remot cabin pennsylvania four stranger come cabin tell world end unless decid sacrific one moral dilemma kill someon love order save billion peopl even know would hijink ensu thing premis movi interest immedi make audienc question decis would make question would ask put situat way movi easili grab problem shyamalan much pose question go motion tell guy get repetit enough develop gay coupl charact help audienc care make decis make therefor movi becom pretti frustrat unsatisfi hand good aspect dave bautista play one stranger leonard invit presenc screen menac sheer size perform abli fight first impress rupert grint play anoth stranger redmond bring bit dark humor probabl scariest stranger also mention even though believ well develop charact ben aldridg jonathan groff play gay coupl eric andrew good chemistri react appropri situat also say one anyth realli dumb movi typic happen home invas movi eric andrew gener make smart decis help protect daughter movi frustrat anyon dumb also know movi rate r realli gore anyth visual scari may curs word imagin enough justifi pg conclus knock cabin decent entri shyamalan filmographi one best also certainli one worst good premis movi anyth present moral play eventu becom repetit although good perform enough charact develop sustain interest individu knock cabin good enough hand popcorn urgenc see theater
103,Knock at the Cabin,"Not just a knock, but another bang in the Renaissance of the enigmatic yet polarizing M. Night.",8,"Shyamalan gets the most extremes sides far as reactions. People either love or hate his movies for his bizarre yet ambitious signature style. The fact that he approaches his films with a ""swing away"" attitude has gained my utmost respect since his mega hit Sixth Sense. Along the way there's been some strikeouts but within the last decade he's created a Renaissance for his films.This particular book adaptation is yet another hit, and will be sure to get people talking. The premise starts out rather straightforward and you quickly find out the stakes are high and massive. The story will grab hold of you and shake you to the core with twists that even though you know are coming will still be shocking even for M Night's catalogue.The acting is absolutely next level with Dave Bautista and Jonathan Groff putting in their raw emotions and prowess into every scene. They will make you feel the story relentlessly . The writing here is also relative and gutsy. The camerawork is as crisp as ever with fantastic wilderness settings and supreme angle work. The cgi for certain scenes used looks authentic and never cheap. The true standout has to once again be the leaps that the plot takes going into to daring territory . It never holds back which is commendable in a time like this.Overall I would easily say that this film will be looked at as one of his stronger ventures and is highly thought provoking to a point where you'll need a second viewing. It gives the classic Shyamalan wonder and curiosity that make him one of the most intriguing directors /story tellers of our time.",shyamalan get extrem side far reaction peopl either love hate movi bizarr yet ambiti signatur style fact approach film swing away attitud gain utmost respect sinc mega hit sixth sens along way strikeout within last decad creat renaiss film particular book adapt yet anoth hit sure get peopl talk premis start rather straightforward quickli find stake high massiv stori grab hold shake core twist even though know come still shock even night catalogu act absolut next level dave bautista jonathan groff put raw emot prowess everi scene make feel stori relentlessli write also rel gutsi camerawork crisp ever fantast wilder set suprem angl work cgi certain scene use look authent never cheap true standout leap plot take go dare territori never hold back commend time like overal would easili say film look one stronger ventur highli thought provok point need second view give classic shyamalan wonder curios make one intrigu director stori teller time
104,Knock at the Cabin,Pretty good film but a shame about the ending,7,"In a world of sequels and IP M. Night Shyamalan continues to give us interesting and original stories. And he tends to get a lot of flack for them sadly. People want original content but then destroy it every time it comes along. It's no wonder we can't have nice things. 'Knock at the Cabin' isn't perfect, but it's certainly a fun ride.The film starts out as a mystery. We don't know what is going on and everything seems very strange and is not making a lot of sense. It's a good way to start a movie. Then we are let in on what is going on and things become particularly interesting. It's at this point that you simply must turn your brain off to logic to get through the rest of the film. Because much like a lot of religion it doesn't make a lick of sense.Where the film let me down was the ending. The book has such a thought-provoking and interesting ending. To get the movie made they were obviously told they would have to change that. It's very disappointing but it's sadly where we are in the world of film. Everyone is afraid they might offend the 1% so the 99% miss out.Still though, the first 9/10 of the movie are a pretty damn good time and are well worth your dollar. 7/10.",world sequel ip night shyamalan continu give us interest origin stori tend get lot flack sadli peopl want origin content destroy everi time come along wonder nice thing knock cabin perfect certainli fun ride film start mysteri know go everyth seem strang make lot sens good way start movi let go thing becom particularli interest point simpli must turn brain logic get rest film much like lot religion make lick sens film let end book thought provok interest end get movi made obvious told would chang disappoint sadli world film everyon afraid might offend miss still though first movi pretti damn good time well worth dollar
105,Knock at the Cabin,Snore At The Cabin*,3,"Having saw previews of this one, I wasn't holding my breath on it being good given who the film was written & directed by.The film sees 2 Dads who are holidaying at a cabin during the summer with their daughter until they're taken hostage by armed strangers who demand that the family make a choice to avert the apocalypse before it's too late.I found the film to be pretty mundane & boring. I mean, like most of M. Night Shyamalan's films, their too out there, slow & pretty boring. This film is no exception. The plot is simple the twist you could sort of see coming a mile a way & the action was very sparing & too few & far between.The pacing is bad, nearly 45 minutes in I looked at my watch. At 94 minutes, 1 hour & 34 minutes, this film is overly long for what it is. I also found the modern day sniping to be unnecessary along with the films underlying cryptic message about sacrifice. The repetitiveness got annoying & didn't once forward the plot or give us any idea on how the film was going to end.Overall, another horror that falls flat on it's face. Can't we just have decent straight forward horrors with no modern day drivel added in? Not to mention a film that doesn't have a weird plot with poor pacing & a off runtime? I don't know.

106,Knock at the Cabin,Tame and mild,2,"Tame and mild are not words I would use to describe any other Shyamalan movie. I don't understand why he takes this route with Knock at the Cabin. It's not restricted by a PG-13 rating like so many other horror movies from cowardly/greedy studios (looking at you M3gan). So why were there numerous times where this movie used strategies seen in PG-13 horror flicks? Every time there was anything close to violence or gore, the camera cuts away. I don't even know what caused this to get an R-rating.As for the movie itself, it's extremely boring and has very little of value. Nothing stands out. Nothing impressed me. The filmmaking is more than competent, but there is almost no intrigue in this story. And it's one of the preachiest movies I've seen in a long time.As someone who's been more patient than most with Shyamalan's flops, that patience is starting to dwindle. I'll always be grateful for movies like Unbreakable, Split, Signs and many others. But I hope he can get back on track soon.

I felt that I left the movie with more questions than answers and an overall feeling of un-fulfillment.

108,Knock at the Cabin,Maybe the end of the world will not come but this movie feel like an apocalypse,5,"The last productions of Shyamalan really disappointed. This one dont do the exceptions sadly. What happened to that man who tried some things pretty original in term of cinematography, story and characters? This one feel like a waste of a time from beginning until the end. The story dont make any sense, the characters too and the writing fell apart. We have also the flashback that seem to give us a perspective of these two mans who adopted a young asian girl. I dont really felt the struggle of these two mans and find the flashback unnecessary and useless in term of the story and just give us a break in the action or an emotional moment. So the apocalypse is supposed to come and we saw that four people attack the young couple and made them forced to do a sacrifice to save the world. And for the entire movie it will be a try to escape, believe them? Or not? The movie dont have anything else to say. The psychology of the characters are completely gone and thats pretey unusual with Shyamalan. And at the end they will save the world by a sacrifice. That was pretty boring and hard to believe: it completely have non sense at all from the beginning until the end. The characters react pretty strangely ( the mentions of visions, make people believed them). I didnt get into the story from the beginning until the end. I dont know why people said it had a twist in the movie: i didnt see anything like this (we just understand that the four people were right about the apocalypse and the sacrifice).

109,Knock at the Cabin,This Movie Represents a Stagnating Shyamalan,5,"Knock At the Cabin is...an interesting movie for me. It's a movie that feels simultaneously too long, too slow, and too short, too quick. To me, it's nowhere near as good as Split, The Visit, or even Old.It's has the most abrupt start of any movie I've seen in recent years. Literally starting where the trailer starts, and it's extremely jarring. By the end of the movie, I wondered why Shyamalan made this bizarre decision. Oh, don't worry, this movie has the odd directorial choices, strange dialog, and weird performances, as most of his films do.But speaking of performances, Knock has some of the best I've seen in a Shyamalan joint. Bautista is absolutely fantastic in this; he's a weird looking and sounding guy. He fits these odd roles better than say, The Rock or John Cena would. And he excels here. Jonathan Goff is really, really good too. Maybe the best performance I've seen from him.The rest of the actors are okay, I guess. Rupert Grint is here and he's quite distracting. The little girl is...well, I found she spoke more like an adult than a child, a common problem in Shyamalan films.The thing about this movie that baffles me is that despite its interesting premise, it doesn't really do much with it. It's a really self contained film, but I honestly felt it needed more. Perhaps a 10-15 minute scene outside the cabin to introduce the characters? Maybe other people (cops, family) concerned about them? Something to give the movie a bit more narrative complexity?It also follows the same formula as Split and Old, with flashbacks doing a lot of heavy lifting, narratively. Yet, it's missing that special Shyamalan flair that those films had and I really enjoyed. It sorta ends how you'd expect it to end.All this sounds like I really hate this movie, but I don't. It's got cool ideas, I think it actually had a homosexual couple that felt like they needed to be homosexual for the story (not necessary, but cool), and I found it kind of sweet at the end. I also thought there were some cool visual moments, and snazzy camera work, but I felt it needed this to prevent it from being totally listless at times.I can't help but feel Shyamalan is sticking to a formula: a lower budget, confined film with lots of flashbacks and (sometimes) based on a little known property. Weirdly, this movie could've used some of this colorful weirdness.

110,Knock at the Cabin,Why oh why did they change the ending?,4,So the film follows the book fairly literally. The horror is more intense in the book but I can accept that. The acting is fine. The book has obviously a lot more philosophical depth but that is hard to convey in a film.But why oh why is the ending changed to some feel good happy ending?!?!? The book had a nice open ending where they walked off into the forest and you didn't know if ithe end of the world stuff was real or not and that was just fine. Why does everything need to be Disney-fied these days? Can people really not cope anymore without happy endings that books need to be rehashed to make the masses feel good.

111,Knock at the Cabin,Cabin believer?!,5,"This film is very M. Night Shyamalen! It reminds me of a mesh match of Josh Whedon's Cabin in the woods & the Happening. Four strangers (Leonard, Redmond, Sabrina & Adrienne) find a same sex couple, Eric (Johnathon Groff) & Andrew (Been Aldridge) and their adopted child, Wen (Kristen Cui) & asked them to make a decision that may or may not determine the fate of the world! The concept is decent enough and I was waiting for the twist ending...The cast is decent; Dave Bautista & Rupert Grint may be the most recognisable. But I have to praise the young actress Kristen for giving a convincing performance. I guessed on the off set that the 4 strangers were the manifestation of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Eric and Andrew are captured and encouraged to make said decision. Their refusal is met by a demise of the strangers one by one.. The complete ignorance of Andrew despite of seemingly predictions coming true makes him very irksome, selfish and annoying character. The ending leaves us waiting for a twist. In typical M. Night.

112,Knock at the Cabin,Knock knock. Who's there. Cabin.,7,"Cabin who? Ya, it's all I got, and that's about as exciting as M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin. The premise of the story was very intriguing, and the casting and performances - especially Bautista, were spot on. But Shyamalan's execution felt more like something you'd expect from an amateur filmmaker. His artistic attempts with all the off-center shots - such as an actors face in the bottom right corner of the entire screen, became annoying fast, especially when it came to the dramatic gore scenes, that seemed to be edited down for 10 year old viewers. Even the backstory of the two dads was boring and pretty much insignificant to the core premise of the film, especially when the narrative was based on ""pure love"". Ya, ok, nothing pure about those two in those backstories, that also lacked anything of substance to make me care for either dad. His screenplay lacked the creativity to give the viewer the thrills and shock-factor this film really needed to give it some bite. At least throw in a twist or two to offset the generic and predictable storytelling. Nevertheless, still a decent one-time watch, but could've easily been so much better.",cabin ya got excit night shyamalan knock cabin premis stori intrigu cast perform especi bautista spot shyamalan execut felt like someth expect amateur filmmak artist attempt center shot actor face bottom right corner entir screen becam annoy fast especi came dramat gore scene seem edit year old viewer even backstori two dad bore pretti much insignific core premis film especi narr base pure love ya ok noth pure two backstori also lack anyth substanc make care either dad screenplay lack creativ give viewer thrill shock factor film realli need give bite least throw twist two offset gener predict storytel nevertheless still decent one time watch could easili much better
113,Knock at the Cabin,What Walt's Watching,7,"""Knock At The Cabin"" just continues to back my theory that nothing good ever comes out having a a cabin especially in the woods.Time after time I've been proven right ever since ""The Evil Dead"" in 1981 and again in 2011 with the biggest parody of this genre from ""The Cabin In The Woods"" also Stephen Kings' ""Geralds Game"".The king of the twist is not Chubby Checker its Director M. Night Shyamalan is back on the big screen for the first time in 2 years.His last outing had people ageing rapidly on a tropical beach in ""Old"" and now four strangers commit a home/cabin invasion during the middle of a global catastrophe.If you had to choose between saving your family or saving humanity. What choice would you make?That's the moral dilemma two ""Daddy's"" have to make when confronted by 4 strangers: the massive Dave Bautista as educator ""Leonard"", ""Servant"" actor Rupert Grint as reformed drunk Redmond, Nikki Amuka-Bird as nurse Sabrina and Abby Quinn as cook ""Adriane"" and all carrying roughly fashioned weapons.What choice or sacrifice would you make if push came to shove?Shyamalan has has been busy making the exceptional ""Servant"" for Apple Plus TV...which is must watch viewing if ""Rosemary's Baby"" is your jam.His latest feature film is also worthy of your watchlist.Some of the clues to this new twist lie in the numbers of invaders and the predictions they make.Sunday Bible study graduates will crack the so-called twist in a New York minute...others may struggle even by the ending.The hardest thing to swallow in ""Knock At The Cabin"" is Bautista as a gentle second grade teacher, but it's possibly his best acting to date.He was cast after Shyamalan was impressed by his performance in Blade Runner 2049 (2017).""Knock At The Cabin"" is based on the 2018 novel ""The Cabin At The End Of The World"" by Paul Tremblay which inspired M. Nights' screenplay.Warning: Around the 30 minute mark you'll witness footage of a strong earthquake in the Pacific which creates a massive tsunami and may shock anyone affected by recent real life events in Turkey.Watch out for: rising star Kristen Cui as ""Wen"" the daughter of the Gay Parents skilfully played by Joanthon Groff as ""Eric"" and Ben Aldridge as ""Andrew"".""Knock At The Cabin"" is a horror, mystery, thriller that will shock you and linger in your mind long after you've left the cinema.",knock cabin continu back theori noth good ever come cabin especi wood time time proven right ever sinc evil dead biggest parodi genr cabin wood also stephen king gerald game king twist chubbi checker director night shyamalan back big screen first time year last outing peopl age rapidli tropic beach old four stranger commit home cabin invas middl global catastroph choos save famili save human choic would make moral dilemma two daddi make confront stranger massiv dave bautista educ leonard servant actor rupert grint reform drunk redmond nikki amuka bird nurs sabrina abbi quinn cook adrian carri roughli fashion weapon choic sacrific would make push came shove shyamalan busi make except servant appl plu tv must watch view rosemari babi jam latest featur film also worthi watchlist clue new twist lie number invad predict make sunday bibl studi graduat crack call twist new york minut other may struggl even end hardest thing swallow knock cabin bautista gentl second grade teacher possibl best act date cast shyamalan impress perform blade runner knock cabin base novel cabin end world paul tremblay inspir night screenplay warn around minut mark wit footag strong earthquak pacif creat massiv tsunami may shock anyon affect recent real life event turkey watch rise star kristen cui wen daughter gay parent skil play joanthon groff eric ben aldridg andrew knock cabin horror mysteri thriller shock linger mind long left cinema

I was very excited to see this and to add the amazing cast. Johnathan Geoff is also a favorite of mine and the fact that he let him sing in this was everything. The acting over all was so great in this. Big props to the little girl as well who really shined. However most of the movie happened in one room which made some of the story drag. There wasn't really a surprise or a twist like most of his movies. Very dooms day meets religious outlooks. Wasn't terrible but didn't live up to some of the greats he has made in the past.

115,Knock at the Cabin,Disappointing Film,4,"I was expecting this film to be be good after watching the trailer but walked out disappointed. The film starts off with a young girl Wen (Kristen Cui) being questioned by a mysterious man Leonard. (Dave Bautista) Wen gets scared and runs to the cabin where her two dads Eric and Andrew (played by Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) are to tell them not to open the door. Soon Leonard and three other strangers are banging on their door demanding to be let in. When they do get in they say that the world is about to end unless one of the parents or Wen dies. Thats the choice the family have to make who to sacrifice. The film starts well, and Dave Bautista puts in an impressive performance. Sadly, however with the film mainly being in the one room it becomes repetitive and boring. The ending is disappointing. Having read what happened in the book I can see why they didn't use that ending but it would have made for a more interesting ending. Like the film Old this was another disappointing film by M Night Shymalan.",expect film good watch trailer walk disappoint film start young girl wen kristen cui question mysteri man leonard dave bautista wen get scare run cabin two dad eric andrew play jonathan groff ben aldridg tell open door soon leonard three stranger bang door demand let get say world end unless one parent wen die that choic famili make sacrific film start well dave bautista put impress perform sadli howev film mainli one room becom repetit bore end disappoint read happen book see use end would made interest end like film old anoth disappoint film night shymalan
116,Knock at the Cabin,A Great Concept Too Padded Out For Time,6,"Knock on the Cabin is a pretty straight forward film that is what it advertises itself to be. Four strangers show up at the cabin of a family of three and propose that one member must be sacrificed by another, willingly, in order to prevent the apocalypse. It's an intriguing concept and there's a lot that could be done with it. Unfortunately, Shyamalan doesn't make it all that interesting. The cast is wonderful, especially Dave Bautista, who once again proves that he has become a fine, charismatic actor.Unfortunately, the concept proves to be the most exciting thing about the movie. There's a lot of dialogue and drama here, but none of it feels all that anticipatory. It's typical musings about belief and and apocalyptic forewarnings. One thing that Shyamalan does succeed in is creating tension in spurts, using cinematography and editing that has come to define a lot of his movies. But these come in waves and it's almost always very tame. I will also say that, after a brief look at the book and how the story unfolds, it feels like Shyamalan went safe with this movie. It's neither all that shocking, nor scary. There are also a bunch of useless flashbacks that feel forced and added in to pad the film out.At the very least, there are a handful of exciting scenes that almost feel like they go hand in hand with the very seldom parts of The Happening that were actually enjoyable. I gave the film the stars I did for Shyamalan creating some legitimate tension, the acting, and the intriguing story. Unfortunately, this isn't a movie I really have much of a desire to see again. The ending is pretty predictable, which is kind of sad considering it's Shyamalan, and a lot of what happens just isn't all that interesting or surprising. That said, this is probably his best film since Split, for whatever that's worth.",knock cabin pretti straight forward film advertis four stranger show cabin famili three propos one member must sacrif anoth willingli order prevent apocalyps intrigu concept lot could done unfortun shyamalan make interest cast wonder especi dave bautista prove becom fine charismat actor unfortun concept prove excit thing movi lot dialogu drama none feel anticipatori typic muse belief apocalypt forewarn one thing shyamalan succeed creat tension spurt use cinematographi edit come defin lot movi come wave almost alway tame also say brief look book stori unfold feel like shyamalan went safe movi neither shock scari also bunch useless flashback feel forc ad pad film least hand excit scene almost feel like go hand hand seldom part happen actual enjoy gave film star shyamalan creat legitim tension act intrigu stori unfortun movi realli much desir see end pretti predict kind sad consid shyamalan lot happen interest surpris said probabl best film sinc split whatev worth

118,Knock at the Cabin,All of humanity has been judged.,4,"M Night Shyamalan's new outing is largely a bland affair, that tries to tick the boxes which we usually associate with the director but sadly apart from the performances, the film doesn't offer anything more. The pace is slow which again is the same with all of his films but this one is devoid of any twists. All that build up for the predictable end simply disappoints.A gay couple with their daughter are at a remote cabin in the woods on their vacation. 4 strangers show up with a crazy demand to save the world from the apocalypse. Though it is an interesting premise, the pay off is not there. The scares are zero, the intensity is missing. Despite this I have to give credit for those effective shot selection. It is not dialogue heavy, just that the scenes become monotonous soon and this one lacks standout scenes.Wait for a better Shyamalan movie continues.",night shyamalan new outing larg bland affair tri tick box usual associ director sadli apart perform film offer anyth pace slow film one devoid twist build predict end simpli disappoint gay coupl daughter remot cabin wood vacat stranger show crazi demand save world apocalyps though interest premis pay scare zero intens miss despit give credit effect shot select dialogu heavi scene becom monoton soon one lack standout scene wait better shyamalan movi continu

I'm sure my review will get mixed vibes which is fair, I'm happy to be one of the odd ones out.

Gold star for Dave Bautista 🌟 It pulled off a few visuals and events I've never seen portrayed in a movie and they were pretty chilling. Also had some really cool camera work and transitions.

121,Knock at the Cabin,I'm good at catching grasshoppers....,8,"While vacationing at a remote cabin in the woods, a young girl and her parents are taken hostage by four armed strangers.They demand the family make an unthinkable choice to avert the apocalypse. Confused, scared and with limited access to the outside world, the family must decide what they believe before all is lost.....When Shyamalan is good, he's very very good. Amazing. His first three films put him on a pedestal so high, that he was destined to fall off it. Then he hit a slump for a very long while. The Village to The Visit were some harsh times for the director, because people were obviously expecting a mind blowing twist. Every. Single. Time. And why the twists were still there, they were not as brilliant as his first three films. And maybe he will never meet those heady heights again.Knock At The Cabin veers quite close to the heights he once had, and after the decidedly dodgy Old, it's nice to see him do a straight forward thriller, which does not feature his trademark twist, which may put off a few people, but then it's adapted from a book, so he's using someone else's work again. And it's no Last Airbender thankfully.From the moment we meet Leonard, the film has this very unsettling tone, that stays with the movie right until the final credits roll, and it gets more and more tense as the film progresses. Bautista is amazing in this, and thus proves that he is the actor that Dwayne Johnson wishes he was. His Leonard is empathetic to the family, but you can see that he wants to explode at them. Every gentle word he users is overshadowed by the tension he has on his face throughout the film. He has the unthinkable job of saving the world. Why him? Why any of them.Obviously the visitors are the four horseman of the apocalypse, and their calmness makes them all the more scarier than they actually are. The weakest link is unfortunately Rupert Grant. Just because he was and always will be Ron Weasley, and you cannot take his character seriously.The news casts are like an end of level boss for the most depressing video game ever, and they hark back to classic Shyamalan. You cannot help but think of the Alien news flash in Signs when you see the devastation, especially the scenes involving aircraft. You also get the obligatory director cameo, but it's very insignificant to the film work it's narrative.It's a really good return to form for the director. It looks great, the cast are great, and the feeling of dread makes the film just that little more claustrophobic.And Bautista looks like a jacked up Alan Sugar.",vacat remot cabin wood young girl parent taken hostag four arm stranger demand famili make unthink choic avert apocalyps confus scare limit access outsid world famili must decid believ lost shyamalan good good amaz first three film put pedest high destin fall hit slump long villag visit harsh time director peopl obvious expect mind blow twist everi singl time twist still brilliant first three film mayb never meet headi height knock cabin veer quit close height decidedli dodgi old nice see straight forward thriller featur trademark twist may put peopl adapt book use someon els work last airbend thank moment meet leonard film unsettl tone stay movi right final credit roll get tens film progress bautista amaz thu prove actor dwayn johnson wish leonard empathet famili see want explod everi gentl word user overshadow tension face throughout film unthink job save world obvious visitor four horseman apocalyps calm make scarier actual weakest link unfortun rupert grant alway ron weasley cannot take charact serious news cast like end level boss depress video game ever hark back classic shyamalan cannot help think alien news flash sign see devast especi scene involv aircraft also get obligatori director cameo insignific film work narr realli good return form director look great cast great feel dread make film littl claustrophob bautista look like jack alan sugar

123,Knock at the Cabin,A Knock in the Head,1,"Let's face, it at this point, Shylaman had been a hack for over a decade. This movie isn't esoteric, it's not misunderstood and it's not unique. The only thing Unique is the fact it was produced rather than simply throwing this pathetic screenplay into a furnace. Truthfully, outisde of a Sixth Sense and Split, Shylaman can simply not write a decent movie. You'll see the same fan boys that somehow gave Old a 10 singing the praises of this poorly written script.

124,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Fantastic,10,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references.

Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions.

128,Everything Everywhere All at Once,To Bagel Or Not To Bagel...,3,"It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.Well, I couldn't get into ""Crouching..."" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like ""2001"" and ""Ratatouille"" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all.",brother recommend watch movi said crazi everi time thought stop watch someth els would happen hold attent quit experi although stick end also remind almost ident experi year ago friend took along see film rave crouch tiger hidden dragon miss mile levit martial art stuff start well get crouch afraid sensori overload everyth everywher go flow sit back let happen probabl best way approach end much sort get idea multipl univers differ version play differ destini independ actual happen us though world disastr collid due emerg intergalact super crimin seem first line defenc michel yeoh unlik middl age laundri owner evelyn whose concern first meet get almost unrecognis jami lee curti hulk auditor sign busi annual account keep busi dull husband take moment reveal altern version call alphavers fight live tri thwart approach big bad super villain whose ident hold back reveal condens plot lot charact straddl univers bare notic earlier suddenli drop back loos call narr think got reason grip one plot strand complet unravel take anoth direct certainli saw thing never seen ever movi includ charact hot dog hand bagel centr human knowledg two inanim rock share convers spoof drawn origin featur like ratatouil two film think ever bracket sentenc also found sever attempt humour often way crude vulgar tast especi get two villain look boost power stick sharp object behind anoth baddi get knock set male genitalia good luck manag comprehend actual enjoy movi end afraid overpow resist mayb giant spoof superhero blockbust obsess hollywood year know despit success box offic rate sort wish two hour least woken altern univers actual watch
129,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Disappointing: more style than substance,4,"Evelyn Wang and her husband Waymond run a laundry. Times are tough and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some niggle with their daughter and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?The plot summary for this movie intrigued me immensely: the idea of exploring how things might work out if you'd plotted a different course or, more broadly, the idea of parallel realities. The actual product, however, is far less engaging or coherent.The lack of engagement begins immediately. The Wangs' everyday life is a manic, unfocussed existence and just following this for the first 20 minutes or so was fairly annoying. It doesn't get any better once the multiverse concept is introduced, this just being an excuse for random detours and well-choreographed but meaningless action scenes.It's like a typical pretentious concept-driven sci fi/fantasy movie: paper over the lack of plot with a concept and developments that are so radical and in-your-face that viewers are fooled into thinking there's something clever there, when there isn't. Then, to make it seem even more important, have the movie go for 140 minutes when 100 minutes would have been sufficient.Every now and again there is a profound moment but due to the preceding scenes being all empty random action there's no context and the impact is diluted.Disappointing.",evelyn wang husband waymond run laundri time tough troubl intern revenu servic also niggl daughter father constant sourc belittl scorn waymond want divorc could thing turn differ evelyn mayb parallel univers plot summari movi intrigu immens idea explor thing might work plot differ cours broadli idea parallel realiti actual product howev far less engag coher lack engag begin immedi wang everyday life manic unfocuss exist follow first minut fairli annoy get better multivers concept introduc excus random detour well choreograph meaningless action scene like typic pretenti concept driven sci fi fantasi movi paper lack plot concept develop radic face viewer fool think someth clever make seem even import movi go minut minut would suffici everi profound moment due preced scene empti random action context impact dilut disappoint

131,Everything Everywhere All at Once,The most original film ever made. Period.,10,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one.

In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors.

A long, long way to push a theme about LGBT acceptance. The anal plugs and dildos were just odd and a strange inclusion. Some of the characters were outright annoying such as the daughter and the various minions. The hubby was OK as he smoothly switched personalities. Good old James Hong still with us, always recall him as ""hey that guy..."". Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the IRS Auditor hamming it up. And Yeoh going through the paces, looks like a bit of a payday for her.

134,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"""I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel.""",4,"Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:Be kind - even if my review isn't.",well start go tri fair review quit honestli go difficult flippant film current top imdb pictur rate rare stray far gener consid opinion chore sit fell asleep length time made differ miss beat fact first time saw end pop screen would okay say perhap defens film truli live name tri everyth everywher good thing took number random idea concept threw blender see came exampl green egg ham topo gigio e mc squar pineappl pizza squirrel nut zipper see easi tell mani time said pleas god let guess give credit film maker least ambiti edit job pictur frequent scene chang skip jump one thing anoth help feel sentiment end suppos help forget went oddli enough abl follow main stori line well enough took forev make point summar would kind even review

136,Everything Everywhere All at Once,It would have been kinder if the reviews had been more honest about the content of this film...I may have skipped it.,1,"This was a long and unnecessarily complex film to get you the message that life and people are messy and you should accept them for who they are. I would have preferred a more straightforward story telling and I could have done without all of the body humor...putting things forcibly in one's anus, ball gag humor, hot dog fingers, eating buggers, etc. I didn't even find that type of humor amusing as a child.The only scene I even remotely enjoyed in this film was the straightforward scene towards the end of the film when Evelyn and Waymond are not together and he explains that he knows she thinks he is weak, but he is fighting in a different way, with kindness. That short but sweet moment is in my opinion, the only redeeming aspect of this film.I have heard some reviewers rave about how this was like the best acid trip...I can't comment on that since I have never done acid and I have no intention of ever trying it, especially since as a healthcare worker I know and understand the very real dangers of doing acid. I will say that I do not watch films to experience an acid trip, I watch films to be entertained and preferably with a good story.This story essentially boils down to a struggling small business owner (laundromat), is being audited by the IRS, not having a good relationship with her husband who has decided to ask for a divorce hoping to just get her to talk about their marriage, and she has a struggling gay daughter who she is avoiding telling her father who didn't accept her marital decision about. Suddenly ta-da, she discovers that there are all these other universes that are populated with other versions of her that made different choices...like didn't marry her husband and didn't move to America. Also, she is the only person uniquely qualified to save this multiverse by tapping into skills from other universes versions. And she is saving it from the big bad who turns out to be her daughter who she created....and her ""everything bagel"".I'd say it was ridiculous, but not once did I laugh and I kind of agree with the viewers who said when they saw ""the end"" on the screen for the first time that would have been happy if that was truly the end.I am sorry. I love both Michelle Yeoh AND Jamie Lee Curtis and would really like to support films anchored by strong female characters...but this film isn't one I can get behind. (Although the message, about being kind and accepting...l am 100% behind! If you can choose to do one thing, be kind is my motto.)

137,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Utter drivel.,1,"In what universe is a film starring Jamie Lee Curtis with hotdogs for fingers considered Oscar-worthy? The answer to that question seems to be 'this one', Everything Everywhere All At Once having been nominated in eleven categories at the 2023 Academy Awards. I'm beginning to wonder if I've somehow slipped into an alternate reality where a film's worth is measured by how quirky, irritating and baffling it is.I believe that this film's success is down to viewers not wanting to admit that they don't 'get' it - ""It's A24, and that means it's intellectual, and if I say I don't understand it everyone will think I am stupid"". Well I think you're stupid for playing along.So what's the film about? Well, Michelle Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, who discovers that the universe is made up of infinite parallel realities, each one different, and that an evil force is attempting to... ah, who am I kidding? I can't sum up this film. I tried to follow the plot, but there's so much random crap crammed into the excruciatingly tedious 139 minutes, all edited so as to induce a migraine, that I soon found myself struggling, not just to understand the plot, but to stay watching till the end.I get that the film is attempting to say something profound about life -- being happy with the choices that we have made, having no regrets, and accepting others for who they are -- but it's hard to give a toss about any of that when faced with such relentless codswallop.Rant over, I'm off to try and find a universe where this film doesn't exist.",univers film star jami lee curti hotdog finger consid oscar worthi answer question seem one everyth everywher nomin eleven categori academi award begin wonder somehow slip altern realiti film worth measur quirki irrit baffl believ film success viewer want admit get mean intellectu say understand everyon think stupid well think stupid play along film well michel yeoh play laundromat owner evelyn wang discov univers made infinit parallel realiti one differ evil forc attempt ah kid sum film tri follow plot much random crap cram excruciatingli tediou minut edit induc migrain soon found struggl understand plot stay watch till end get film attempt say someth profound life happi choic made regret accept other hard give toss face relentless codswallop rant tri find univers film exist

I really can't remember the last time I watched a movie until the end and feeling utterly dejected without walking out--the closest is one of the more recent superhero movies (Avengers). Both titles have received high praise both from critics as well as audiences--but I did not connect with either of them. Clearly I am not the target-audience--I have little patience for films that claim to be ""smart"" by the sheer amount of confusion they cause--but a movie hailed by many as ""nearly perfect"" is hardly watchable.For most of the first 30 min, I felt assaulted by the sheer barrage of sounds and visuals which made very little coherent sense. I was wrong. In the next two hours, the film showed me I was an idiot--the first 30 min was the better part actually. As the movie went on, my sense of assault and confusion only increased.

141,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Comparing to PARASITE, yes this movie is indeed overly hyped and rated",1,"People usually say, ""overhyped"" or ""overrated"" if a movie doesn't live up to a fame. Sometimes it's agreeable, but oftentimes it's hard to agree with them because many claims with baseless information like the one with Titanic. How many people can really agree with someone saying ""Titanic is overrated""? Well, today I'll make a point of why Everything Everywhere All at Once is overrated with a nutshell information by comparing with the move, Parasite. When Parasite was getting popular in US, I was thinking, ""it's probably because it's leveraged by a social trend"". However, ""Boy, was I wrong"" that's what I said right after watching the movie. I could understand why it gained so much popularity. The movie is well scripted and well directed, but most of all, it's a movie that nobody has ever seen before which is probably why the movie received a big applauds and awards at Cannes and others. It's understandable completely that Parasite is definitely not overrated. However, in case of Everything Everywhere All at Once, it's also well scripted and well directed, but the plot and EVERYTHING in this movie is something I've seen in many movies and TV shows over and over especially with multiverse and the family dynamics. There's ZERO wonder why it didn't get any attention from Cannes, and the movie is basically unknown in other countries except US. The movie's fame is only leveraged by the social trend only in US. I can expect this movie will grab a lot of Oscars, and also can expect this movie will easily be forgotten unlike Parasite.*Keep in mind that I'm not a diehard fan of Parasite. I do like the movie, but I'm only using it because it makes a good comparison with Everything Everywhere All at Once especially with Cannes award.",peopl usual say overhyp overr movi live fame sometim agreeabl oftentim hard agre mani claim baseless inform like one titan mani peopl realli agre someon say titan overr well today make point everyth everywher overr nutshel inform compar move parasit parasit get popular us think probabl leverag social trend howev boy wrong said right watch movi could understand gain much popular movi well script well direct movi nobodi ever seen probabl movi receiv big applaud award cann other understand complet parasit definit overr howev case everyth everywher also well script well direct plot everyth movi someth seen mani movi tv show especi multivers famili dynam zero wonder get attent cann movi basic unknown countri except us movi fame leverag social trend us expect movi grab lot oscar also expect movi easili forgotten unlik parasit keep mind diehard fan parasit like movi use make good comparison everyth everywher especi cann award

143,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Way overhyped,6,"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes.

144,Everything Everywhere All at Once,The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!,9,"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building.

145,Everything Everywhere All at Once,What a perfect title for this movie.,9,"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",everyth everywher sometim mani thing mani place get lost help focu thing obvious amaz michel yeoh one thing focu whole reason came see flick first place much movi give absorb easi keep eye beauti yeoh oh kid indiana jone templ doom flick older odious still sound like kid form gooni lucki got play yeoh babi daddi joint last definit least good see jame wong film could tell like made film adjust assur someth year old actor role legend flick speak legend almost forgot jami lee curti seem like fun role fact movi multivers low key expect multivers connect yeoh play movi charact shang shi would cool interest like third movi came march mommi daughter relationship asian women even interest go order turn red year old mom umma year old mom girl play yeoh daughter look like possibl earli know becam hot plot movi admit prefer stori lay relat asian woman middl schooler music film great movi film context stori laundromat owner mid life deal came go music actual fit perfectli ideal woman key save multivers made lot entertain big orchestra cue make sound like watch dune contradict imag yeoh worn blue collar mom spectacular say good place handl process good cast concentr
146,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Not very much, here.",2,"First of all if you have seen this film and loved it I am sorry. I'm not dissing you, everyone has their fave things. And I'm sure some found this to be a great film.However, I tried 3 times to watch it before I finally understood what was going on. Once I did, I realised why it had taken 3 times. Basically, it's a crap film.Let me explain why it's crap.Firstly you have no clue what's coming but a couple of middle aged Chinese taking their laundry receipts to the IRS to face a bulldoggish middle aged woman who makes uninteresting speeches about their receipts is NOT interesting. Neither is the fast talk in the elevator which still does not really explain anything and I found it to be confusing.Then what is all that about a divorce? Are they divorcing? Why? What has this to do with the film?Then suddenly the security come and her husband turns into a King Fu killer taking them all down with a scarf, before IRS lady staples something (unknown) to her head and attacks them. All the while phone earpieces that glow green are chucked about and laundry woman goes is seemingly magically transported from place to place, talking about her dog and her IRS bill and her divorce.Utter, rubbish. Pure and perfect trash. I was actually irritable at not being able to see what everyone is banging on about. It's not a great film, it's an awful one.

Time with friends gives you a chance to float, reflect, of how your mind has crashed and burned, become a wreck, with their help they catch your fall, assist the break with a large maul, evict the poison from your heart, with great effect.I thought Anna Kendrick was amazing as the mentally anguished and tortured Alice, who's fairy-tale romance had turned out to be anything but, as she finds out what friendship and love really can be, when those close truly care.",man subtli coerciv relationship vile corros play trick think make wither narrow shrink way spend day life live time friend give chanc float reflect mind crash burn becom wreck help catch fall assist break larg maul evict poison heart great effect thought anna kendrick amaz mental anguish tortur alic fairi tale romanc turn anyth find friendship love realli close truli care
150,"Alice, Darling",In a relationship with a Narcissist,6,"Feeding on attention whether it is positive or negative, the need to control others, manipulation, blame, and the absence of empathy; such are the signs of narcissism. Alice's boyfriend Simon possesses such traits in large amounts. In a rare moment away from him and in the company of her friends at a cottage in Ontario, Alice reflects on her situation. Noticing her stress, doubt, depression, and shame, Alice's friends attempt to open her eyes to the emotional abuse. However, Simon is not yet ready to let go of his possession.While Alice is going through this emotional turmoil there is a missing teenage girl in the town. Alice observes that, ""if this girl is hurt, it is probably by someone she knows."" Alice begins to wonder if there is more to life than Simon.Since I was once married to a narcissist, I recognized Alice's plight and coping mechanisms. It was interesting to see how the character dealt with the abuse. Anna Kendrick (Alice) is in a different role from her normal comedy routines. She does a good job of portraying a character attempting to reclaim herself from someone who feeds on her soul. I wish the film went deeper in many ways, but it does an excellent job at revealing the toll that narcissists take on our lives.World premiere in Toronto.",feed attent whether posit neg need control other manipul blame absenc empathi sign narciss alic boyfriend simon possess trait larg amount rare moment away compani friend cottag ontario alic reflect situat notic stress doubt depress shame alic friend attempt open eye emot abus howev simon yet readi let go possess alic go emot turmoil miss teenag girl town alic observ girl hurt probabl someon know alic begin wonder life simon sinc marri narcissist recogn alic plight cope mechan interest see charact dealt abus anna kendrick alic differ role normal comedi routin good job portray charact attempt reclaim someon feed soul wish film went deeper mani way excel job reveal toll narcissist take live world premier toronto

Anxiety and trauma oozed off Anna Kendrick and the supporting casts' was no different in their roles; the antagonist gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time, but it's all he needed.While the acting was great and I enjoyed an abuse story that's not trauma porn or exploitave, the story left a lot to be desired. Before watching it I saw it only had a 90 minute run time, and thought ""seems short for subject matter."" Sure enough, the plot felt rushed and underdeveloped. The story could've been explored on a much deeper level, and the characters make choices that don't make sense.

152,"Alice, Darling",Has something to offer but it's too slow and simple,5,"I like the concept here of the vast difference between actual love and narcissistic control. Narcissistic personality disorder is when someone needs to control and manipulate other people to feel like they're human. They're basically lacking a soul and feed of others in a nutshell.This film tries to portray this subtle abuse by showing mostly the abused victim and not the actual abuse so most of the film is the lead female being stuck in a relationship and it just doesn't do much else. She's with her friends and not in the actual abuse for most the screen time.The ending is pretty good, but the slow first hour or so really drags. I would have like to have seen more of what created her abuse symptoms and also how she was before meeting her Narc boyfriend.Overall the acting is good, but the plot is too slow for most audiences and didn't really progress. It also is dealing with very subtle things in a very subtle way as well so it misses the mark on being an effective drama or thriller and is more just a character study. 5/10.",like concept vast differ actual love narcissist control narcissist person disord someon need control manipul peopl feel like human basic lack soul feed other nutshel film tri portray subtl abus show mostli abus victim actual abus film lead femal stuck relationship much els friend actual abus screen time end pretti good slow first hour realli drag would like seen creat abus symptom also meet narc boyfriend overal act good plot slow audienc realli progress also deal subtl thing subtl way well miss mark effect drama thriller charact studi
153,"Alice, Darling",Strong performances but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would,6,"Alice, Darling (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of friends who decide to go on a girl trip to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of the friends, Alice, has a psychological and verbally abusive boyfriend she needs to lie to, to go on the trip. She spends the entire trip scares to death he will find out about the trip. As her friends discover what's bothering her they will do their best to help her overcome her fears.This movie is directed by Mary Nighy (Traces) in her major motion picture directorial debut and stars Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Kaniehtiio Horn (Possessor), Charlie Carrick (Deep Water) and Wunmi Mosaku (His House).The storyline for this had a lot of potential and the cast is outstanding and delivers strong performances. The chemistry between the cast was tremendous and felt authentic. You could feel the anxiety oozing through the screen and the friends genuine desperation to help their friend. However, there were decisions throughout the picture by both the friends and Alice that didn't feel realistic and was frustrating. The subplot of Angela missing was under utilized, and while a metaphor, could have had a better conclusion that was more impactful and less subtle. There's a sex scene in here that's the strangest thing I've ever seen. The ending was solid but I thought they'd show more of the husbands abusive ways in an explosive climax.Overall, this is an okay movie with some redeeming elements but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",alic darl movi wife saw theater last night storylin follow group friend decid go girl trip celebr one birthday one friend alic psycholog verbal abus boyfriend need lie go trip spend entir trip scare death find trip friend discov bother best help overcom fear movi direct mari nighi trace major motion pictur directori debut star anna kendrick pitch perfect kaniehtiio horn possessor charli carrick deep water wunmi mosaku hous storylin lot potenti cast outstand deliv strong perform chemistri cast tremend felt authent could feel anxieti ooz screen friend genuin desper help friend howev decis throughout pictur friend alic feel realist frustrat subplot angela miss util metaphor could better conclus impact less subtl sex scene strangest thing ever seen end solid thought show husband abus way explos climax overal okay movi redeem element push envelop far thought would would score recommend see
154,"Alice, Darling",Impactful,7,"I didn't know how to write all the thoughts and feelings this movie made me feel. I also thought for a long time whether it is really worth writing everything, because the whole review will not be about the movie, but about the theme of this movie. I don't want to talk about this movie from a technical point of view, because I don't think it's the most important thing in this case. Yes, I think the movie is really good, but that's probably because I found so many similarities in it and I realized that I wasn't the only one who suffered from this kind of relationship. In short, the film is about a young woman trapped in an abusive relationship, and I think this is a very important topic to talk about, because an abusive relationship is very traumatic for people and their lives. There are many people in this world who are now in toxic relationships, and there are also many people who have been in this type of relationship before.A very important point is that the film is very realistic. Of course, each person's case is different, but the whole point is abusive relationships and how being in them affects people's inner world and mental health. People feel trapped, like they have no other choice, they think that their partner is treating them badly out of love. For such people, it seems that this is how love should be, after all, just like in the movie, Simon said to Alice: ""It's you and me. It's just us."" Being in such a relationship is like losing yourself, at least in my opinion, the motif of the missing girl in the film shows exactly that. At that time you are absolutely addicted, if you go somewhere you feel guilty for not being with a partner, if you are having fun you feel guilty again for not being with a partner. When the partners of an abusive relationship are already completely attached to their victim, it becomes more and more difficult to escape from such a relationship.But that's not the case, there is a way out of all these horrible things, whoever is reading this right now and is in a relationship like this, there is a way out. There will always be people around you in difficult times who really love and want to help. In the case of the film, it was Alice's friends who helped her escape from an abusive relationship. Although at first it seems that no one understands you, that everyone else is your enemy, but the truth is completely different.Alice says: ""I know this sounds crazy, but sometimes it feels like he can read my mind"" and ""There's nowhere left that I can actually be alone."" And this is absolutely true, because people in such relationships lose themselves, forget what they really are, they can't even think logically anymore. Also, hair pulling is a very real experience caused by a very high level of stress. In fact, the movie looked so familiar that it was hard to watch.I really highly recommend this movie because it does an excellent job of revealing the main idea and raising a very important issue. Some viewers may find it difficult to watch, but the film is definitely worth watching.",know write thought feel movi made feel also thought long time whether realli worth write everyth whole review movi theme movi want talk movi technic point view think import thing case ye think movi realli good probabl found mani similar realiz one suffer kind relationship short film young woman trap abus relationship think import topic talk abus relationship traumat peopl live mani peopl world toxic relationship also mani peopl type relationship import point film realist cours person case differ whole point abus relationship affect peopl inner world mental health peopl feel trap like choic think partner treat badli love peopl seem love like movi simon said alic us relationship like lose least opinion motif miss girl film show exactli time absolut addict go somewher feel guilti partner fun feel guilti partner partner abus relationship alreadi complet attach victim becom difficult escap relationship case way horribl thing whoever read right relationship like way alway peopl around difficult time realli love want help case film alic friend help escap abus relationship although first seem one understand everyon els enemi truth complet differ alic say know sound crazi sometim feel like read mind nowher left actual alon absolut true peopl relationship lose forget realli even think logic anymor also hair pull real experi caus high level stress fact movi look familiar hard watch realli highli recommend movi excel job reveal main idea rais import issu viewer may find difficult watch film definit worth watch

While at the cabin Alice's shackles are ripped off.

156,"Alice, Darling",Not truly on point,6,"So this is a story about a woman that's in a controlling and emotionally manipulative relationship with a man. At least that's what it appears to be. And I say that because this story is so wildly unclear, and at best you're guessing. It's like they took a story, then cut out all the stuff that would explain what actually happened. And then stuffed it full of everything that happened between the stuff that happened. And rely on you to understand the plot without telling you any of the actual story.This is not a great way to make a movie. This is a great way to debut how actors can describe things with just their range of emotions, and they are amazing in that. The acting really is top notch. But the story is so bare bones, that I simply can't give it a great rating.6/10 great acting, very lackluster story.",stori woman control emot manipul relationship man least appear say stori wildli unclear best guess like took stori cut stuff would explain actual happen stuf full everyth happen stuff happen reli understand plot without tell actual stori great way make movi great way debut actor describ thing rang emot amaz act realli top notch stori bare bone simpli give great rate great act lacklust stori
157,"Alice, Darling",Everybody acting UNNECESSARILY weird for ninety minutes. VERY,3,"First off, it took FOR. EV. ER to get to the point of the movie... secondly, are we really sure this movie just isn't about some girl who is completely out of her mind who created her own angst?? Unless i missed something, they did a really poor job of making the boyfriend seem verbally or even emotionally abusive... matter of fact, most of the the interactions they show of the couple actually make the guy out to be fairly nice, mild mannered, sometimes affectionate and fairly thoughtful.But instead of 'show and tell' the movie tries to outline how abusive he has been to the girlfriend in flashbacks and through her recanting stories to her friends, but even then, he doesn't seem to have really done anything bad enough to merit this woman's anxiety.In one scene she tries to explain how bad her relationship is because, as she says, ""sometimes i think he can read my mind and if he can do that then there is nowhere left that i can be alone""
meanwhile, her friends are looking at her while speaking these words like she just told them he beat her with a bat.There's another scene where she's telling her friends how much the boyfriend doesn't like potato chips as she imitates the boyfriend... ""there's enough saturated fats to kill a horse. You'll regret those when you get on the scale in the morning"".Again, the friends are sitting beside her making faces to each other like, ""oh my god - this MONSTER said that to you??!!"" """"
""i wish you would have told us it was this bad"" they tell her (seriously)
and finally, they layered a backdrop of a missing girl on this little getaway for some sort of subplot that I can only think they were trying to make the viewer fear the boyfriend (?) all the while they never really give you a reason to fear the boyfriend that much at all.This is a hard pass for me.

Nothing ever does. You'll watch, wait for something significant about her backstory, and never get it. Then you'll wait for that big climax, but it doesn't happen. And then the credits roll.

159,"Alice, Darling",Annoyingly dull and boring.,5,"Even at a mere 89 mins of runtime, the sloth pacing made this annoyingly dull and boring film feel like 3+ hours long. Listed as a drama-thriller, it's remarkably un-thrilling, and the drama wasn't dramatic; the missing girl sub-plot had more drama to it.Co-writers Alanna Francis and Mark Van de Ven left all the meat and potatoes off the plate and served up just some tasteless kale posing as a fancy salad. Even the subplot with the missing girl was a pointless red herring - why even write that in? To make matters worse, the writers didn't convince me that Kendrick's character didn't already have pre-existing social anxiety issues, before trying to sell me that the boyfriend is the problem, especially how she was to her so-called best friends. The entire narrative just felt undercooked and incomplete, lacking any real impactful intentions the writers had.Then you have director Mary Nighy taking already boring scenes, and making them awkward and unbelievable. The three gal's friendship was unconvincing, as was their handling of each others insecurities towards themselves and each other, so to make the audience believe they have the ability to help (or even want) the victim, was simply unrealistic and unconvincing.The only believable performance was Kendrick, as Nighy failed to properly direct the rest of her cast effectively, especially the other two girls. I respect the message that was trying to get conveyed, but all attempts to do so were too weak and contrived, and the end result fell short of any accomplished messaging.I can't recommend this, because I really would've rather watch paint dry for what felt like over three hours.

164,"Alice, Darling","Thanks to the beginning director and writers, the story unfortunately remains a bit on the simple side.",5,"Alice, Darling is a new drama thriller directed by Mary Nighy. This is the first movie she has directed and has only directed some episodes of different TV series before this.In the film, Alice (Anna Kendrick) goes away with her friends Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku) and Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) for Tess's birthday. She lies to her partner Simon (Charlie Carrick) about this. She has an uneasy relationship with Simon, in which Simon always dominantly makes the decisions for them.This lie turns Alice's time with her friends from a fun girls' trip into a precarious one. For example, Alice begins to wonder if she should go public with her problems to her friends. This can only completely ruin the fun.Besides the fact that this is only the first film that Mary Nighy has directed, this is also only the second film for which writers Alanna Francis and Mark Van de Ven have written the story. Because of the starting sides of both of them, they keep this film a bit on the simple side. Unfortunately, the message about someone who is in an uncomfortable relationship with a partner who makes all the choices is not very strong.With this film they also take their time to make it clear to you as a viewer what exactly this film is about. For example, in the beginning you first have to try to guess what kind of film you are going to see. The storytelling of the film is unfortunately a bit on the rushed side, so the film sometimes jumps quickly from scene to scene, to show some different moments. As a result, the story can sometimes remain a bit difficult to follow and the film is sometimes filled with unnecessary scenes, which have little or no value for the final ending.It also takes a while before you clearly learn about the different relationships between all the characters. As a result, the acting in the beginning of the film unfortunately does not come across very well at first. Fortunately, this changes later in the film and most actors know how to act better and more clearly. You just keep missing a clearer history of the characters, to really understand them. Due to the lack of background information and some lack of other details, the film sometimes comes across as too rushed or simple. As a viewer, this makes you wonder why the characters can't just talk about each other's problems as friends.Anna Kendrick looks good in the lead role, but this is not her best acting. She has done better acting in her other films. Kaniehtiio is also more of a TV actress and knows how to do nice acting, but does not do anything special with her role. Wunmi Mosaku plays more like the backbone of the girlfriend group, trying to balance everything between everyone. Charlie Carrick unfortunately comes forward a bit too exaggerated in his role, so that the film loses some of its credibility.",alic darl new drama thriller direct mari nighi first movi direct direct episod differ tv seri film alic anna kendrick goe away friend sophi wunmi mosaku tess kaniehtiio horn tess birthday lie partner simon charli carrick uneasi relationship simon simon alway dominantli make decis lie turn alic time friend fun girl trip precari one exampl alic begin wonder go public problem friend complet ruin fun besid fact first film mari nighi direct also second film writer alanna franci mark van de ven written stori start side keep film bit simpl side unfortun messag someon uncomfort relationship partner make choic strong film also take time make clear viewer exactli film exampl begin first tri guess kind film go see storytel film unfortun bit rush side film sometim jump quickli scene scene show differ moment result stori sometim remain bit difficult follow film sometim fill unnecessari scene littl valu final end also take clearli learn differ relationship charact result act begin film unfortun come across well first fortun chang later film actor know act better clearli keep miss clearer histori charact realli understand due lack background inform lack detail film sometim come across rush simpl viewer make wonder charact talk problem friend anna kendrick look good lead role best act done better act film kaniehtiio also tv actress know nice act anyth special role wunmi mosaku play like backbon girlfriend group tri balanc everyth everyon charli carrick unfortun come forward bit exagger role film lose credibl

And maybe some people were just shocked to see Anna Kendrick in a serious drama. It's not a thriller, more a dramatic film. For those who don't see the abuse, you must not understand emotional or verbal abuse. It's not all showed initially but as the film progresses, Alice recalls conversations which are terribly abusive and controlling. He's chipped away at her self-esteem and confidence until she's turned into something she doesn't know or like. Her friends barely recognize her but see her pain and depression.

The behind the scenes interview with Director Mary Nighy and Anna Kendrick implies it was intentionally subtle but irregardless of the intent the execution was poor. The movie is full of setups that aren't acted upon. The resulting execution is a movie that never really starts.The movie plot at its core is a uninspired story about an insecure girl with a mousey personality that has her sense of self is overpowered by the stronger personality of her boyfriend. Of course Hollywood portrays it as the dudes fault as an abuser in a relationship despite never laying a hand on her or threatening her in anyway. Yet his very being and thoughts are framed as physiologically abuse.The only thing amazing about this movie was that it got made but within an ecosystem where the demand for content grossly exceeds supply by a wide margin, the formula for Green-lighting movie projects has devolved to where any sceenplay that manages to sign a known actor to a role gets made.

167,"Alice, Darling",A compelling yet incomplete directorial debut.,8,"Anna Kendrick really does give a career-best performance as Alice, a woman in turmoil and denial over her emotionally abusive relationship. Really, the whole cast is incredible, and the highlight of this film is the interactions between the three friends as they peel back the layers of Alice's abuse.Each of the three friends has a distinct personality, clearly different set of life experience, and manner of communication. It makes it easy to connect with them immediately and understand their perspectives and sympathise with their plights as they try to both evade and help each other.The film also does a terrific job of exploring the psychology of Alice. It can be easy to dismiss people who are being abused because it's hard to understand why they don't just leave the relationship. But it's so understandable here; Alice has become so emotionally dependent upon her boyfriend who appears kind and supportive on the surface but is so needy and manipulative in his speech that he's become an emotional leech without her realising it.I loved how the film didn't make Simon out to be straight-up evil and sadistic. He's an otherwise normal guy who doesn't think anything he's doing is wrong or abnormal, but is in desperate need of a reality check. It's complex and believable.What didn't work for me is that this movie simultaneous feels too short and too long. The climax is emotionally resonant and satisfying in its own right, but it seemingly leaves multiple plot threads dangling that retrospectively feel like they were just there to kill time and didn't contribute much of meaning to the story or themes.A multitude of scenes should have either been cut or expanded upon to give more weight to Alice's precarious situation. As it is, the movie feels slow because of all the fat in the script that wasn't capitalised on.Even so, the performances and dialogue are often so compelling and satisfyingly intricate that they alone make the film worth a watch.

169,"Alice, Darling",This movie is a waste of talent and time,2,Anna Kendrick gives a great panicked performance that shows a range from her usual quirky roles. I expected so much more from this movie In the movie they show her on a trip with her friends hiding out from her abusive boyfriend. She learns how to sue an axe to chop wood. They hint that she likes swinging the axe and it feels good so I assumed that was going to be the ending. I was looking forward to the killing of the boyfriend but instead they just split up and that was the end of the movie. This was 2 hours of nothing and wasted potential.Like I said I wanted to like this because I like most of Anna Kendrick's movies. She was the executive producer and I think she should have pushed for more risks in this movie because its a glorified Lifetime movie.The boyfriend is portrayed as a rapist and sexual abuser and there is no consequences to this. They just break up so he can go do it to someone else. Skip this movie if you have the chance. I am also a man so maybe with women they connect with it more but as a man who likes rom-coms etc this movie was a terrible slog to get through.,anna kendrick give great panick perform show rang usual quirki role expect much movi movi show trip friend hide abus boyfriend learn sue axe chop wood hint like swing axe feel good assum go end look forward kill boyfriend instead split end movi hour noth wast potenti like said want like like anna kendrick movi execut produc think push risk movi glorifi lifetim movi boyfriend portray rapist sexual abus consequ break go someon els skip movi chanc also man mayb women connect man like rom com etc movi terribl slog get

172,"Alice, Darling",A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Exploration of Abusive Relationships,9,"A powerful and thought-provoking drama that delves into the complexities of an abusive relationship. The film, directed by Mary Nighy and starring Anna Kendrick, is a raw and unflinching look at how easy it can be to become caught in the undertow of a bad romance.The plot of the film centers around Alice, a young woman who is in a relationship with Simon, an abusive partner. The film follows her struggles as she tries to navigate her relationship with Simon and the growing concern of her friends, who can see the red flags of his behavior. The film is well-written and thoughtfully directed, with Nighy balancing perspectives in a way that feels genuine and authentic.The acting in the film is top-notch, with Anna Kendrick delivering a stunning performance as Alice. Kendrick's portrayal of a person who is overwhelmed by the pressure of an abusive relationship is both heartbreaking and powerful. She is able to communicate the character's struggles with a range of reactions, from catatonic vacant stares to succumbing to heaving waves of a panic attack on the bathroom floor. Her performance is a departure from her usual bubbly screen presence and a testament to her acting abilities.The cinematography in the film, by Mike McLaughlin, is also noteworthy. The film has a distinct visual style that effectively captures the murkiness and isolation of Alice's relationship. The world in which Alice lives looks a little less bright than that of her friends, adding to the sense of isolation and disconnection.The only downside to the film is that it tries to add an element of danger to the story through a subplot about a missing young woman. While this subplot is intended to add a sense of urgency to the story, it ultimately feels like an unnecessary complication.Overall, ""Alice, Darling"" is a must-watch film that tackles the difficult subject of abusive relationships with sensitivity and nuance. The film's performances and direction are outstanding, and it is a powerful and thought-provoking piece of storytelling.",power thought provok drama delv complex abus relationship film direct mari nighi star anna kendrick raw unflinch look easi becom caught undertow bad romanc plot film center around alic young woman relationship simon abus partner film follow struggl tri navig relationship simon grow concern friend see red flag behavior film well written thought direct nighi balanc perspect way feel genuin authent act film top notch anna kendrick deliv stun perform alic kendrick portray person overwhelm pressur abus relationship heartbreak power abl commun charact struggl rang reaction cataton vacant stare succumb heav wave panic attack bathroom floor perform departur usual bubbl screen presenc testament act abil cinematographi film mike mclaughlin also noteworthi film distinct visual style effect captur murki isol alic relationship world alic live look littl less bright friend ad sens isol disconnect downsid film tri add element danger stori subplot miss young woman subplot intend add sens urgenc stori ultim feel like unnecessari complic overal alic darl must watch film tackl difficult subject abus relationship sensit nuanc film perform direct outstand power thought provok piec storytel
173,"Alice, Darling","Shallow - more shallow - Alice, Darling",5,"Without a doubt, abusive relationships are an extremely important subject of our time. If sophisticated and served with the required depth, even movies might clear things up and maybe even change things for the better. Sadly, this is not the case here. This movie's main flaws are in it's shallowness and clearly one-sided view on a very sensitive topic:(1) All we experience is Alice's suffering and incapability to break out of her relationship. There is a victim and a culprit -- that's how simple it is presented in a strictly subjective way. But monsters are made, not born. What about her boyfriend, why is he acting like this and how did he become who he is? This would have been one of the rare cases where flashbacks would have made sense. The film totally misses the opportunity to make the audience understand the mechanics and causes of this relationship by showing both sides of the story.(2) We learn about Alice as a character who is suffering in an abusive relationship. That's it. But who and how was she before she met him, why did she fall in love with him and how did she change? It would have been a much more emotional impact, if the audience would have been able to compare her former self to the current situation.(3) In an abusive relationship, there are only victims -- meaning the abuser is also suffering. Since her boyfriend suffers from personality disorder, he's a sick person. How does he suffer, what about his other relationships to friends etc.? Did he made some efforts to get healing? There's nothing like that in here, because that would not fit his awfully simplistic role: The evil torturer.(4) Making a movie about mental health issues bears a great challenge: You have to explain it properly to the audience -- otherwise it will be misunderstood, with all the after effects. Not everyone, who criticizes his partner, likes a certain haircut on him or needs his confirmation from time to time, is a narcissist. This movie fails here completely and serves every wannabe psychologist very well.Without a doubt, due to it's simplified and one-sided approach this movie will surely comfort a certain part of the audience. Anyone else, who is rally interested in this matter, will most likely be disgusted by it's shallowness. I don't think it was the intention of the creators but if you see it in the most negative way, this movie is sexistic even. A female abuser would have made it more interesting but here it's a white male in his 30s. Guess what.Nevertheless and despite the several deep flaws in it's storyline etc., the movie is well shot. Acting is decent, especially Wunmi Mosaku and Charlie Carrick do a great job. I give 5/10 stars, because it's technically well done and picks up an important subject -- though it could tell it's shallow story in 30 minutes.",without doubt abus relationship extrem import subject time sophist serv requir depth even movi might clear thing mayb even chang thing better sadli case movi main flaw shallow clearli one side view sensit topic experi alic suffer incap break relationship victim culprit simpl present strictli subject way monster made born boyfriend act like becom would one rare case flashback would made sens film total miss opportun make audienc understand mechan caus relationship show side stori learn alic charact suffer abus relationship met fall love chang would much emot impact audienc would abl compar former self current situat abus relationship victim mean abus also suffer sinc boyfriend suffer person disord sick person suffer relationship friend etc made effort get heal noth like would fit aw simplist role evil tortur make movi mental health issu bear great challeng explain properli audienc otherwis misunderstood effect everyon critic partner like certain haircut need confirm time time narcissist movi fail complet serv everi wannab psychologist well without doubt due simplifi one side approach movi sure comfort certain part audienc anyon els ralli interest matter like disgust shallow think intent creator see neg way movi sexist even femal abus would made interest white male guess nevertheless despit sever deep flaw storylin etc movi well shot act decent especi wunmi mosaku charli carrick great job give star technic well done pick import subject though could tell shallow stori minut

It's poorly written, there are some directorial shots that would never make a movie made by a studio, and there is some pretty cringe acting as well.

The pacing is a bit off and the effects at times were notably bad.But what did you expect on a budget under $100,000 made by amateurs? I don't feel like my time was wasted by people who used an IP as a lazy money grab. I thought the team tried and did what they could within their means.There were a handful of cool directorial shots, a few fun kills, and some bad in an entertaining way scenes that made this at least watchable. It's a really short film that isn't an absolute chore to get through. This isn't even the worst horror film I've seen this year.If the next time around there is a bigger budget, better writing/editing, and better casting it could be fine.

176,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A Big Ol' Pile of Unfinished Pooh!,2,"This movie is not a finished product, not even close. This needed AT LEAST a month or two longer in the editing room because it is a mess! I'm not even talking about the terrible story or acting because I knew I was getting that regardless, which is no problem for me as long as there's some carnage. I'm talking about the atrocious sound mixing/editing, the abrupt cuts and transitions, and nauseating camera work. The basics of filmmaking! Whenever someone is getting murdered, you can't even tell what is going on because the camera work is so amateurish and shoddy. It's almost like the camera operator was having a seizure whenever they were supposed to film a kill.This movie had a $100,000 budget, yet they showed almost no gore/make-up FX when someone would die. If you're filming a low-budget B horror movie, people are going for the kills and not much else, therefore you better be pumping 80% of your budget into the ""horror"" aspect of the movie and show some people getting slaughtered.Terrifier 1 had a $25,000 (a fraction of Blood and Honey's budget), yet showed every kill in grisly detail and people LOVED it! Then they made a sequel for $250,000 and made 13 million off it. I'm not sure where the $100,000 budget of this movie went, but it was most definitely not the kills, editing or acting. Maybe Pooh and Piglet's costumes were each $50,000 a piece, and if so the costume designer definitely pocketed that money.The only reason I'm not giving this a 1 is because I like the concept of taking a fictional character from the public domain and putting a B horror twist on it. Though a good concept, the execution could not have been much worse. This should not have left editing room let alone released IN THEATERS! The distribution company should be held accountable.

177,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,"Stupid as hell idea, but it can be entertaining if you give it a chance.",7,"There are some cases of movies in which just by seeing the poster you have a good glimpse of what you are going to watch. There's no point in me doing a synopsis, because if for some sick reason you've ever dreamed of a movie where Winnie the Pooh (yes, the bear from your childhood) goes psychotic and on a killing spree, that's just what you're going to get in this movie.I want to clarify something, being objective this is not a good movie even remotely. As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.So why do I give it a 7? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.In short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all. If you don't find the idea of Winnie the Pooh killing people at least a bit fun, you should do well by skipping this one.",case movi see poster good glimps go watch point synopsi sick reason ever dream movi winni pooh ye bear childhood goe psychot kill spree go get movi want clarifi someth object good movi even remot far slasher concern quit mediocr although brutal death end overshadow film terrifi give plot although quit stupid funni time see fat bear tortur kill victim someth worth see even curios funniest thing movi comedi might seem like take serious make fun also must say piglet squeal give film plu short best way watch movi understand one bad good movi take serious find idea winni pooh kill peopl least bit fun well skip one
178,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A movie without much to offer.,4,"Talking about ""Winnie the Poo: Blood and Honey"" carries a lot of negativity, it's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen but it's bad enough, the script is empty and full of nonsense dialogues and incoherent actions, whose only attraction is to see two famous characters from the animation as villains. The cast tries to do their best but the way their characters were written fails to make them stand out, giving only flat performances. The make-up effects are efficient but the computerized blood that oozes from the victims is quite unreal and detracts from the gore.

179,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A Terrible Excuse of a Mess!,1,"I like films and movies in general and horror is one of my favorite genres. Lately I've been getting into the more low budget films where the filmmakers rely on creativity over showing off the budget on special effects and past their prime actors looking to still be in movies. A lot of the ones I've seen in fact have fallen into the ""so bad it's good"" or cheesy and over the top category that you can't help but have fun because everyone involved with the film clearly was while making it!Unfortunately this is a train wreck that absolutely needed more time to be polished. The worst part about this is that you can see that there some solid foundations in some of the way the shots were setup & the premise is a decent one to build from. The problem is that this looks like it was executed by someone who is learning to make movies, which is fine, but it probably should've gotten more time in front of other filmmakers that could've pointed out the obvious flaws.One big flaw that this movie has is that the narrative is difficult to follow. Scenes that should establish who the characters and help the audience follow what is happening with them as the story progresses is non-existent. Characters literally pop in & out of thin air and things happen to them but you don't see how the story takes them from point a to b. In additions to this, the movie is impossibly dark to the point where you literally can't see anything except random things meant to represent the characters and objects they're holding or moving around! Several scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell where the characters are in relation each other or the scenery. Movies are a visual medium, you need to see what is happening or at least have an inkling of what is unfolding even if you're not supposed to see thing la clearly!The plot about Winnie-the-Pooh and the other forest animals turning feral after Christopher Robin left them to be an adult was a good starting point but ultimately went nowhere. Why did Pooh & Piglet wind up torturing or killing people if they became ravenous from hunger instead of eating them? Why is Christopher Robin just barely in the movie, while the focus is on a bunch of other characters that we literally know nothing about?Clearly you can see the inexperience of the director on display here as some scenes and shots are well done while others are absolute trash. I'm sure given enough time they will improve with more movies under their belt but they need someone to help guide & mentor them so that they can make a movie that is watchable. Sure, this was a micro budget effort but it's advertised like it has more money behind it than it really does. If this guy had a solid fundamentals I'd be complaining more about the story than how everything is presented! And the presentation doesn't require fancy cameras or special effects, you just need good clear shots and narrative flow which don't require a ton of money if given the time to do it right!Lastly, I heard that there is already a sequel in the works? How in the hell did this piece of garbage manage to get a sequel greenlit and Zack Snyder had so much difficulty getting more movies made in the DC Universe?!

This one is just bad.,1,"Let me start by saying that I went into this expecting it to be very, very bad, but sometimes that makes for a fun watch so I was open-minded. Literally the ONLY decent thing about this movie is the score; everything else, the acting, the writing, the plot, the complete and utter lack of even so much as an ATTEMPT at character development, was a complete mess. It's not one of those horrors that are ""so bad it's good"", it's just painful to sit through from beginning to end. Full of plot holes, completely lacking a protagonist, full of characters who are uninteresting and un-likeable, I can't imagine how anybody could enjoy this movie.",let start say went expect bad sometim make fun watch open mind liter decent thing movi score everyth els act write plot complet utter lack even much attempt charact develop complet mess one horror bad good pain sit begin end full plot hole complet lack protagonist full charact uninterest un likeabl imagin anybodi could enjoy movi
181,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Winnie the Pooh:Cringe and Strangely bad,2,"First of all, the movie is really bad but its badness has made it entertaining in certain aspects. The main reason for the badness of the film is the acting. It may be the worst cast I've ever seen in my life. They act so badly in every scene that it's unbelievable. The acting is a disaster and it really ruined the movie.There were 3-4 bloody scenes in the movie that looked good in the cinema, but some scenes were incredibly unnecessary and long. Also, the nudity was forced on us before the characters died. It would have been better if they had chosen the cast according to the movie's requirements.Actually, when I first heard about the movie, I thought it might be interesting. It has a low budget and a different structure. However, the screenplay that the director chose was extremely bad, which ruined the movie. Although I really liked the animation in the first part, the costumes of Piglet and Winnie were incredibly artificial and awful, which turned the horror scenes into comedy.It would have been better if it had been written much better and if it had been adapted to the screen with good costumes in a short time. Unfortunately, our director has made very bad choices and has created a disaster of a movie. He has disrespected the characters' past. There's really nothing worth watching in this movie.2.",first movi realli bad bad made entertain certain aspect main reason bad film act may worst cast ever seen life act badli everi scene unbeliev act disast realli ruin movi bloodi scene movi look good cinema scene incred unnecessari long also nuditi forc us charact die would better chosen cast accord movi requir actual first heard movi thought might interest low budget differ structur howev screenplay director chose extrem bad ruin movi although realli like anim first part costum piglet winni incred artifici aw turn horror scene comedi would better written much better adapt screen good costum short time unfortun director made bad choic creat disast movi disrespect charact past realli noth worth watch movi
182,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,good bloody fun,9,"If you're going into this movie expecting a multimillion dollar budget movie with an Oscar nominated script, your going to be disappointed. This has been described to me as ""a perfect experience for fans of B movie slashers"" and that's exactly what I got. I'm glad I saw the movie in theaters (Mexico City) because I had a complete blast.I think they pulled this off by being in on the joke. It almost plays as a satire of the slasher craze from the 80's. They knew they were making a Winnie the Pooh slasher and they leaned hard into the premise. I laughed, I was shocked (the deaths are all super fun and creative), and I was impressed by the cinematography and music (especially for this budget which I think is probably less than $100k). In short, it's just a good time if you know what you're signing up for.Similar to Terrifier 2, this is a super low budget horror movie getting a huge amount of attention and press and that's so exciting to me as a lifelong horror fan. I personally want to live in a world where that happens more often. So yeah I gave it two extra stars for that reason alone.

183,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,What a waste,2,"If there are any ""real"" directors reading this; there is clearly an interest in a Winnie the Pooh horror. This isn't it.I don't even know where to start in expressing the sheer disappointment of this ""film"". What's worse, it doesn't appear to be an issue about the low budget - more the direction. We have all seen recently what can actually be achieved with a small budget. It would appear this ""director' got very lucky with an interesting idea, but has no idea how to actually make a film.Our cinema was about half full, but after 45 minutes I would guess half of those had left. Not because it was scary or gory or too intense - but, my guess, and along with us, bored out their minds. By about an hour in the rest of the audience had broken into conversation. We left with about 15 minutes left as just couldn't take another second.On the way out I asked for a refund (never done that before lol). The guy behind the counter laughed and said a couple others had said the same thing.So what's wrong with it? Well, first and foremost its not scary. It's also not funny or clever or interesting or well shot. It drags on and on with super bad acting, awful music, bad editing, bad camera work, dreadful lighting, terrible dialogue, super cheap looking costumes.... and I could probably go on.Sometimes bad films can be a cheesy, campy good time but the absolute killer here is - it's boring.The world of horror has some absolutely fantastic up and coming directors and its a shame someone with some talent didn't have this idea and execute it properly. But as Winnie is now public domain, maybe someone will.And, somebody needs to ban these people from ever making another film. And, I want my money back.As I was writing this review I came across a review in the Daily Beast by Nick Schager (full credit to him for the below and the full article can be found online/socials) that puts it so much more eloquently than I have been trying to:""Frake-Waterfield exhibits minimal skill at framing a unique or unnerving shot, effectively transitioning between scenes, or eliciting jolts though canny cuts or audio cues. He's not helped by Vince Knight's muddy, shaky cinematography and Andrew Scott Bell's comatose score, which loses steam at precisely the moments that is should be punctuating the action.Its difficult to fault the musicians for their lethargy, however, in light of the omnipresent amateurishness on display, almost none of which can be blamed on production constraints; though its clear that Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey was made on a shoestring budget, its failings have to do with a simple lack of talent both in front of and behind the camera.In the weeks leading up to Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey's premiere, the writer/director has expounded on his plans to film a series of additional children's lit horror shows, with Bambi and Peter Pan next in line for the grim dark treatment. On the basis of this fiasco, however, that feels like so much wishful thinking. For all of Pooh's kills, the greatest casualty of his rampage may just be Frake-Waterfield's career prospects"".",real director read clearli interest winni pooh horror even know start express sheer disappoint film wors appear issu low budget direct seen recent actual achiev small budget would appear director got lucki interest idea idea actual make film cinema half full minut would guess half left scari gori intens guess along us bore mind hour rest audienc broken convers left minut left take anoth second way ask refund never done lol guy behind counter laugh said coupl other said thing wrong well first foremost scari also funni clever interest well shot drag super bad act aw music bad edit bad camera work dread light terribl dialogu super cheap look costum could probabl go sometim bad film cheesi campi good time absolut killer bore world horror absolut fantast come director shame someon talent idea execut properli winni public domain mayb someon somebodi need ban peopl ever make anoth film want money back write review came across review daili beast nick schager full credit full articl found onlin social put much eloqu tri frake waterfield exhibit minim skill frame uniqu unnerv shot effect transit scene elicit jolt though canni cut audio cue help vinc knight muddi shaki cinematographi andrew scott bell comatos score lose steam precis moment punctuat action difficult fault musician lethargi howev light omnipres amateurish display almost none blame product constraint though clear winni pooh blood honey made shoestr budget fail simpl lack talent front behind camera week lead winni pooh blood honey premier writer director expound plan film seri addit children lit horror show bambi peter pan next line grim dark treatment basi fiasco howev feel like much wish think pooh kill greatest casualti rampag may frake waterfield career prospect
184,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Does not utilise it's premise at all.,2,"I fully expected Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey to have indistinguishable disposable characters, kills that are gross and mean-spirited, a bone-thin plot, inane dialogue, and acting that is...mediocre at best.I was right about the film having all of these things, and I didn't mind these things. They're par-for-the-course in the slasher genre, and I embrace the self-aware trashiness of it all.What I was not prepared for was just how boring this movie is. And it's because it does not even attempt to make use of its characters that should make for a slam-dunk of a hilariously enjoyable concept.Christopher Robin and his college friends should have been the focal characters. But Christopher Robin is barely in this movie and instead we get a group of vapid girls who have no relation to Christopher. They get killed off instead, and there is no reason to care because they're completely detached from the connection between Pooh and Christopher at the beginning of the film.It would have been so easy for them to capitalise on a concept that could only be found in Winnie-the-Pooh: the animals kill Christopher's family and friends as revenge for him abandoning them. But the plot we got could be interchanged with literally any other plot in the slasher genre, as it's just a bunch of randos getting killed.What also doesn't help this disaster is the awful editing. Almost every shot lasts longer than it should, and it makes each scene feel agonisingly long.It's a film where we watch a lot of half-baked ideas play out on screen, and none of them are unique. None of them are what I wanted to see from a concept as silly as this.This could have been hilariously good fun.

185,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Pooh!,1,"Let me make it clear that I'm not offended by the idea of a Winnie the Pooh horror movie. Such a movie isn't going to ""ruin my childhood"". However, this particular Winnie the Pooh horror is very bad. It starts off explaining how Christopher Robin found and befriended genetic freaks called Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and Owl. They remained friends until Christopher went off to college and left them to fend for themselves. Unable to find enough food, the rest of the animals killed and ate Eeyore, which led to them becoming feral and taking a vow of silence. This part of the movie was adequately done, but it was all downhill from here. The rest of the movie has two men in unconvincing Winnie the Pooh and Piglet masks going around killing people in gruesome ways. What happened to Rabbit and Owl? I don't know, they were nowhere to be found.

Most of them were of limited budget.Another thing and IMDB need to stop this, all the 8, 9 & 10 star votes are from people associated with this car wreck of a movie in one way or another.Now onto the movie itself, this one should be missed by everyone, why?Well the acting didn't bother me so much as I didn't expect much from it in the first place.This film is bad, from the story line to the 'let's get a lesbian couple in here, so people will think we are a modern film' brigade.It could have been such a great fun film and it wasn't.The death scenes were tiresome, the so called blood scenes were barely visible. Pooh and Piglet just looked as if two actors just went to a joke shop and bought some cheap masks.Will this poor attempt of a film get a sequel, I suppose it will but I won't rush to see it.Do yourself a favour and give this one a very wide berth and don't waste you time.",firstli say massiv horror fan small big budget bother next thing want say review said call film shine way spotlight slasher movi believ fact say give bad name limit budget anoth thing imdb need stop star vote peopl associ car wreck movi one way anoth onto movi one miss everyon well act bother much expect much first place film bad stori line let get lesbian coupl peopl think modern film brigad could great fun film death scene tiresom call blood scene bare visibl pooh piglet look two actor went joke shop bought cheap mask poor attempt film get sequel suppos rush see favour give one wide berth wast time

They die almost immediately so the rest of the movie is just pointless. There's no story really beyond that. All the acting is awful, the characters are lame. The villains are just two guys in masks that aren't scary at all. They didn't even try. The gore was a let down. The movie was too dark to see what was going on half the time. The sound sucked. The writing was awful. I turned it off halfway through and I almost never do that with films, despite having watched plenty of truly awful movies.

197,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Lost Potential,2,"This film had great potential to be a great film, featuring well know and beloved characters as evil villains as opposed to be sweet and harmless. The concept and the idea of it was great! Of what happens after Christopher leaves his friends for college and doesn't return for so long. But the execution of this concept was a complete disappointment.The start of the movie was promising, with eerie, 2D animation in black and white like children's drawings depicting the past of Christopher discovering the famous characters and what they did when he left, but it immediately went downhill from there within the first ten minutes of the film.The acting was poor by a majority of the actors, but it didn't help either that their written dialogue was also so empty, flat and lazy. Absolutely none of the characters were well developed enough to like, even in the slightest bit.The animated blood and gore was exciting and promising for a thriller, aiming to invoke disgust and unease, but the way in which it had been animated was done so poorly that online content creators could do better. It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't good either.The number of inconsistencies constantly left me confused throughout the movie, wondering and questioning why characters were behaving in certain ways when it made no sense, or where things suddenly came from, everything felt like such a let down.Halfway through the movie, I had posted the thought to my friend I was watching it with that perhaps this film was attempting to be a satire but was just bad at it, and they looked it up to find that this movie genuinely was a serious attempt at a thriller movie.There is simply too much done poorly for this movie that it outshines its very, VERY few positive parts. It was genuinely such a disappointment I wanted to walk out in the first ten minutes.If you watch this as a satire and don't take it serious, you'll be able to get a good lot of laughs from it. I know I did. But as a serious thriller movie, it just didn't turn out well.The idea and concept of the movie was great.

199,True Spirit,"Inspiring adventure, script and graphics struggle.",6,"Years ago I read ""Sailing Alone Around the World"" by Joshua Slocum and I have been a solo Cape Horn groupie ever since. There were some great books including Naomi James engrossing ""At One with the Sea."" At the start the success rate of solo round the Horn was about 50%. It has improved with technology and weather data but is still a risky exciting enterprise. The sailors all seemed a little bit odd, I felt a kindred spirit. Cf ""Voyage for Madmen"", also filmed. So, I bussed down with my nearly 10 year old granddaughter to see ""True Spirit"" when it opened at Maroochydore.At the time of her voyage, I had wondered if there was some pressure on the sailor for the trip, but the more I saw of her the more she seemed to be a determined independent young lady who had her own ideas. I have been steadily impressed with her. She is not seen chasing 'celebrity'. I was however a little apprehensive about the film, as there were no reviews, - this could be one of those over-earnest paeans that the Antipodes can do. The granddaughter is a hard critic. Well, she liked it and watched earnestly right through. It does have a bit of an old-fashioned feel to it. No slaughtering superheroes or flying hedgehogs. I am glad I took her to see it.I thought it wasn't bad, with reservations. The storm scenes/CGI were a little unreal. (like in 'Perfect Storm' - graphically spectacular, but distracting) This detached me from the drama. And the general sailing was less absorbing than it might have been, though I know solo sailing isn't all excitement, it can be done. Apart from the 'over the top storms' the photography was good. The sea is a good act to watch.The dialogue often tends to be formulaic and occasionally cloying. Shame; a lot is good. Teagan Croft is excellent as Jess, she seemed to be the character. Cliff Curtis was great as the mentor Ben Bryant. Anna Paquin good as ever and generally the actors were fine. Some things I vaguely remember from the time, such as the flyover by the parents (-must have been emotional.) and the wait before the Horn, were barely dealt with but excusable in the name of good editing. At 106 minutes it was about right. Actual footage of Jessica at the end was quite moving.Sarah Spillane has avoided over adulation. There are some script failings but still very watchable reproduction of Jessica's exploits. The determination and achievement of the young sailor were recognised in the film and anchored it.",year ago read sail alon around world joshua slocum solo cape horn groupi ever sinc great book includ naomi jame engross one sea start success rate solo round horn improv technolog weather data still riski excit enterpris sailor seem littl bit odd felt kindr spirit cf voyag madmen also film buss nearli year old granddaught see true spirit open maroochydor time voyag wonder pressur sailor trip saw seem determin independ young ladi idea steadili impress seen chase celebr howev littl apprehens film review could one earnest paean antipod granddaught hard critic well like watch earnestli right bit old fashion feel slaughter superhero fli hedgehog glad took see thought bad reserv storm scene cgi littl unreal like perfect storm graphic spectacular distract detach drama gener sail less absorb might though know solo sail excit done apart top storm photographi good sea good act watch dialogu often tend formula occasion cloy shame lot good teagan croft excel jess seem charact cliff curti great mentor ben bryant anna paquin good ever gener actor fine thing vagu rememb time flyover parent must emot wait horn bare dealt excus name good edit minut right actual footag jessica end quit move sarah spillan avoid adul script fail still watchabl reproduct jessica exploit determin achiev young sailor recognis film anchor
200,True Spirit,The movie lacks true spirit,5,"I watched this as I am a sailor and I was curious to see where her story fit in with Abby Sunderland, who tried the same feat at teh same age but failed after a storm in the southern ocean.As some have said I also think the film was made in a Disney style to highlight the spirit of exploration, adventure and courage. It does it splendidly and is a joy to watch for that reason.As a record of Watson's achievement though I think it falls short. The things she went through including being becalmed for a full week would have been horrifying. And the storm scenes almost romanticise storms rather than showing the real turmoil that Watson went through.It showed nothing of the struggle she would have faced sailing the boat although does touch on her loneliness.

It's the story of Jessica Watsonl who's always dreamed of sailing around the world by herself. She's on a quest to be the younger person to do so.As you'd expect, she certainly has her share of obstacles. But she shows the true grit needed to complete such an adventure. The film goes from her at sea, to flashbacks of her growing up and all the things that led to this amazing adventure.I thought the acting was absolutely spot on. The photography and special effects were tremendous as well. And it's full of breathtaking action scenes that make you feel you're on board with her. There's one absolutely gorgeous scene when she's caught in a dead-air zone. She stares at the night sky just full of stars with the David Bowie's ""Star Man"" quietly playing. It's quite haunting.If you're looking for a great film the whole family will enjoy, don't miss this one! But be sure to have some tissues handy.

Her mentor Ben Bryant (Cliff Curtis) has a troubled past. Her supportive parents (Josh Lawson, Anna Paquin) raised her on the waters. Her dad does have concerns while they face disbelieve and questioning from the outside world.This is a generally solid inspirational film. Teagan Croft is cute and energetic. Cliff Curtis is the solid veteran actor. Lawson is a character actor and it's funny that I probably know him best from Mortal Kombat. It's great to have Anna Paquin as the mom. She herself won the Oscar when she was twelve. It's all very nice and very safe. The safe part is a bit of a problem. I'm never concerned about her journey except for a small moment during the climatic storm. The movie needs to build more danger into the movie. It needs to start with Bryant's unfortunate sailing incident. It also needs to recount one or two sailors who died during their attempts. It needs to push the danger more. Instead, they leave it to the slimy news guy and the danger disippates.

In 2009 - where even today you wait minutes to get simple weather data.I laughed at the scene where she was taking her mainsail down with bare hands like it was nothing in a huge storm, which magically tightens itself up while she gets washed overboard.

While the media and news were afraid of the risks. Her family being concerned and worried. The plot is inspirational as it follows her when she was young and motivated as she has everything planned out for her sailing trip. The acting is great. The film can be thrilling when she comes across some powerful storms in the ocean while her family are worried. The direction is stunning with its cinematography.

Ridiculous cringe worthy moments that really didn't need to be added. The story didn't need it, but the Director couldn't help themselves. At its worst it was like a soap opera episode and the music Director shouldn't be allowed anywhere near music, shocking is too polite a word for that.Also some of the extra characters were so cliche as to be almost rude. They literally put an African lady dancing when she was watching on video, only surprised the Scottish woman wasn't pissed.Anyway after all that the acting by the lead characters was fine and the story itself is so amazing it was still enjoyable.

212,True Spirit,A Perky but Limited Telling of a Historic Journey,7,"A biographical movie about Jessica Watson, who became the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the world alone in 2009. The film, which stars Teagan Croft and is directed by Sarah Spillane, details Watson's journey and the support she received from her family and manager.Despite criticism from the media and government officials, Watson persevered and completed her journey, overcoming multiple storms and windless stasis. The film showcases the beautiful sailing sequences and pays homage to Watson's determination, making her a symbol of the ""can-do spirit.""However, the film has its flaws. The screenplay tends to disrupt the dramatic momentum, and the perky, clean-scrubbed tone makes the film feel like a Disney Channel movie. The film also oversimplifies the story, focusing solely on vindicating Watson and her family and coach, while ignoring the messiness of real life.Overall, ""True Spirit"" is a suitable movie for younger audiences, but for those looking for a more nuanced and thorough account of Watson's journey, her memoir and the 2010 documentary ""210 Days"" are recommended.",biograph movi jessica watson becam youngest sailor circumnavig world alon film star teagan croft direct sarah spillan detail watson journey support receiv famili manag despit critic media govern offici watson persev complet journey overcom multipl storm windless stasi film showcas beauti sail sequenc pay homag watson determin make symbol spirit howev film flaw screenplay tend disrupt dramat momentum perki clean scrub tone make film feel like disney channel movi film also oversimplifi stori focus sole vindic watson famili coach ignor messi real life overal true spirit suitabl movi younger audienc look nuanc thorough account watson journey memoir documentari day recommend

And while I was twice Jessica's age, when she did her circumnavigation, Jessica's tenacity, determination and passion to follow her dreams, inspired me to do the same. To follow my own dreams.This movie adaptation of the real story IMO was executed beautifully. It was skilfully edited which kept the narrative flowing in a good pace. No unnecessary drawn-out dull moments. It kept me engaged the entire time. The CGI and filmography was equally good.But the best part was the directing and the actors. The director did a fine job steering the movie and leading the actors. The main actors, all did a tremendous job bringing their characters to life. I'm sure it's even harder when portraying real-world characters. There was not a single dud among them. But the true standouts were Teagan Croft (playing teen Jessica), and Alyla Browne (playing young Jessica). These two were brilliant.The only criticism that I have in the movie is the clothing Jessica was shown wearing during a violent storm off the coast of Tasmania. Not sure if that was truly what she was wearing in the real-world. But if it was, she should have been in her storm weather gear.VERDICT: A great true story adventure-drama captured wonderfully in this movie.

222,True Spirit,Inspirational Stuff,7,"I tried to get my kids to watch this, hoping the inspirational story line would give them ideas beyond sitting and playing games on the iPad. But I failed so I watched this myself. It follows the true story of 16 year old Jessica Watson attempting to fulfil a (let's face it) very short, life long dream of being the youngest person to sail solo around the world.The film delivers, albeit in a bit of a lightweight way. The danger elements were few but done well. The sea does look scary at points, but I wanted a little more edge of the seat stuff. But this is aimed at the 10-16 crowd, so perfect in that respect.The film is almost 2 hours long, but it takes a long time for the world journey to actually start and the pacing of the film from that point is a bit too quick. Half way round The world in the blink of an eye. It is a true story and I can't believe it was all plain sailing (excuse the pun) for that half of the journey. It would have been nice to have a few more elements of danger and drama.It's always great to see Anna Paquin, but young Teagan Croft was excellent as the young protagonist sailor. I originally thought she was a bit too wide eyed and perfect teeth for the role, but at the end of the film you do see footage of the real Jessica Watson on the original boat and they are actually very similar in looks, so good casting in that respect.If you can get your kids to watch this, I would highly recommend!",tri get kid watch hope inspir stori line would give idea beyond sit play game ipad fail watch follow true stori year old jessica watson attempt fulfil let face short life long dream youngest person sail solo around world film deliv albeit bit lightweight way danger element done well sea look scari point want littl edg seat stuff aim crowd perfect respect film almost hour long take long time world journey actual start pace film point bit quick half way round world blink eye true stori believ plain sail excus pun half journey would nice element danger drama alway great see anna paquin young teagan croft excel young protagonist sailor origin thought bit wide eye perfect teeth role end film see footag real jessica watson origin boat actual similar look good cast respect get kid watch would highli recommend

I hoped that once we had got passed the preamble, which is appalling, we might see some actual sailing but no, we're constantly interrupted by flash backs to the girls' earlier childhood with incessant reminders that she has to prove herself because she is a girl. It might also have helped to have given the girl some sailing training, she is lacking in basic skills like casting a line ashore, for example. In the sequence when she is departing Sydney harbour she is on a close reach, ie. Sailing as much directly into the wind as possible. It's a point of sail guaranteed to give entertaining sailing yet when she gets a small amount of spray in the mush she seems shocked. I tapped out shortly after. There's probably a great story here and the girl deserves it to be told better than this.

225,Plane,Surprisingly white-knuckle,7,"Yeah, it's constructed entirely out of familiar parts, without a single groundbreaking or original element. But Plane is able to fly above its generic ground by making the most of its actors and inherently tension-rich premise.Gerard Butler actually gives his best performance in years here. If this was just a paycheck for him, he certainly doesn't act like it.And director Jean-François Richet wisely paces the film in such a way that the characters have tangible time to breathe and take in what's happening between bursts of frantic action. He allows his actors time with lengthy shots to display the emotion their characters ought to feel.And because we see the characters feeling it, we feel it too. Even though the plot is largely predictable and formulaic, I felt the white-knuckle tension of the brutal action and the entire unhinged hostage situation because the visual focus of the director is always on the people in this story and the fear they feel.Richet uses almost exclusively handheld camerawork for this film, and I have mixed feelings on that. It does help with chaotic sequences to elevate the unease, but it also hinders the film when we should be seeing the outcome of fight sequences and it's sometimes obscured.Although I probably won't be watching it again and will likely forget about it soon, this is a surprisingly more-than-functional action flick that is certainly worth a watch for escapist entertainment.",yeah construct entir familiar part without singl groundbreak origin element plane abl fli gener ground make actor inher tension rich premis gerard butler actual give best perform year paycheck certainli act like director jean fran oi richet wise pace film way charact tangibl time breath take happen burst frantic action allow actor time lengthi shot display emot charact ought feel see charact feel feel even though plot larg predict formula felt white knuckl tension brutal action entir unhing hostag situat visual focu director alway peopl stori fear feel richet use almost exclus handheld camerawork film mix feel help chaotic sequenc elev uneas also hinder film see outcom fight sequenc sometim obscur although probabl watch like forget soon surprisingli function action flick certainli worth watch escapist entertain
226,Plane,"Yes it's flawed, but just what we needed...",6,"I figured out pretty early on that it didn't take itself seriously or at least Gerard Butler didn't.14 pax out of Singapore just before Christmas? The flight should have been full. There were lots of errors in predeparture and the comms with the tower when they taxi for take off. And no other planes? The set up was easy to see, prisoner being transported, bad storm and then we're off.This had all the hall marks of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and any other action film you can think of from the 80s. After all the dross coming out of Hollywood why not just bring a film out to do one thing and that's entertain. And that's what it did. No woke (and that's a word I hate) message, no easily identified alphabet people (because it didn't matter). Just an action film, a hero and the usual tropes to propel it along. Believability played no part as it didn't in Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando or Rambo (and any subsequent parts). Just a hero, a dubious helper (the prisoner, who's part was never explained but had skills) , a hapless bunch of passengers and some native evil doers with guns. Let the popcorn flow.I wish they had done more with the passengers, they turned out to be just there and will not be remembered. They certainly could have amped it up more and taken the 80s action higher but it was a good time waster and I felt no need to think beyond what was shown.

227,Plane,Thank You For Flying Trailblazer Airlines,7,"This is a lean and yet solid 7 star shopping mall cinema action film starring the ultimate.throwback shopping mall cinema action hero, the modern day Gerard Butler. Not 300 Gerard Butler. The Gerard Butler now. Gerard Butler 2023, here equal parts Snake Plissken and Ben from Leaving Las Vegas. Unshaven, puffy and pale. I don't know if I want him flying my airplane but I still love him even after all these years, and I'm along for another ride. Heck, I even got frequent flyer miles.Here on Flight 119, Butler as Captain Brodie Torrance, does what he always does best. He makes you believe, and he kicks a little butt.Dare I say that his character participates in a one-on-one fight scene so intimate and visceral that it could hang with anything seen in a Raid film (major compliment!) or even, yes, the new Avatar sequel. It's true.There are other actors, longtime veteran character actors as part of the passenger list, or airline administration in this movie that are an absolute joy to see on the screen.Joey Slotnick (Twister) as a pain-in-the-neck passenger, you just know something is going to happen to him and it ain't good!Paul Ben-Victor (Body Parts) as a by-the-book airline executive, and Tony Goldwyn (Ghost) always bringing his best to every role. No different here.Two standout performances by co-star, Mike Colter as Louis, a prisoner on international transport on this relatively empty New Year's Eve commercial flight, and lastly, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous flight attendant, Bonnie played by Daniella Pineda. Wow.I will say this, there is no end scene but there most definitely should have been one with one of those characters for sure. I won't reveal who.The movie is a tight hour and forty-seven minutes which is most welcome in a world where it seems every movie regardless of genre or content easily runs well over two hours.Are there far superior plane crash/disaster films? Sure.Castaway comes to mind. Even Con-Air, which this seems to pull from just a bit.But this is a very good brainless movie. Just take your brain out before watching, eat your popcorn and enjoy.This is an entertaining and needed theatrical release.

The plane has no way to communicate its position and things become a survival game just for a short while.Not abusing spectators patience. The duration es perfect.There are couple of short tender scenes but delay the events for a few minutes; but that is nothing compared with the tension it generates the whole time.In brief; is an excellent emotional movie that deserves an audience.,plane almost perfect movi gerard butler differ kind action hero cerebr violent younger guy violent part bad guy bunch least form unknow asian guy realli terrifi insert romanc nice ladi basic male movi stori simpl plane drop accid island manag separatist rebel plane way commun posit thing becom surviv game short abus spectat patienc durat es perfect coupl short tender scene delay event minut noth compar tension gener whole time brief excel emot movi deserv audienc
230,Plane,Great 90s throwback,8,"The CG isn't convincing but that can't stop Plane from being a great 90s throwback that knows exactly how to execute all the expected genre tropes in fun and satisfying fashion and further proves that leading man Gerard Butler is the current king of B movies.Butler himself gives a terrific lead performance, charming and confident with the ability to humanise his leading man in a few scenes that linger on the shock and horror at the situation. Mike Colter is great with a deliberately closed off performance that makes him hard to read in a way that increases the tension.Together the two of them make for a likeable duo and don't overdo it with the rapport. Also worthy of mention is Tony Goldwyn whose character may be one note but he elevates the role so much and rescues his scenes out of their mundane nature.Jean-François Richet's direction is so good, the camera is constantly mobile and most importantly always comprehensible with a standout one take early on that kicks things off beautifully. The music by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp is so overly dramatic and that's exactly why it works.The pacing is basically perfect as well, at a tight 107 mins it doesn't even come close to over staying it's welcome, taking just the right amount of time to set everything up and build up to the crash and once they're on the island it just goes and does not let up.",cg convinc stop plane great throwback know exactli execut expect genr trope fun satisfi fashion prove lead man gerard butler current king b movi butler give terrif lead perform charm confid abil humanis lead man scene linger shock horror situat mike colter great deliber close perform make hard read way increas tension togeth two make likeabl duo overdo rapport also worthi mention toni goldwyn whose charact may one note elev role much rescu scene mundan natur jean fran oi richet direct good camera constantli mobil importantli alway comprehens standout one take earli kick thing beauti music marco beltrami marcu trumpp overli dramat exactli work pace basic perfect well tight min even come close stay welcom take right amount time set everyth build crash island goe let

233,Plane,"A 90s throwback, but I wish it was better",5,"Plane reminds me of the action movies of my youth. Most 90s action movies are pretty bad by today's standards, but I don't mind going back to the feel of those movies, modernized and updated to the latest action standards. Plane does this fairly successfully, yet still falters when it comes to making a good overall movie.The action itself is pretty good for the most part, although there isn't much of it. There's a pretty tense scene early on, a gritty fight scene I really enjoyed, and a mediocre finale sequence. Three action scenes isn't enough for a nearly 2 hour movie.Everything is surface level. There is no depth. It's filled with subplots but none of them are fleshed out even a little. And there is definitely some dumb stuff, like the worst customer service associate in movie history, or moronic side characters. There are a couple extra cheesy moments as well. I rolled my eyes multiple times.This review may seem very negative, but I did mostly enjoy this movie. It's more than serviceable. I just wish it was better, especially since I'm exactly the target demographic and am prone to liking dumb action movies. I hope we see more attempts at modernized 90s throwbacks, but done right.

235,Plane,Search and Rescue,7,"Plane is a good action film filled with intense acting, gunshots, fights, and story. The story goes along with Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) flying his crew and passengers on an airplane with an dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) on board. When they fly into international waters that everything does not go according to plan. A violent storm strikes the plane causing them to land in a remote island somewhere in the Philippines filled with armed rebels. Brodie Torrance, Gaspare, and the military must rescue and escape with the crew and passengers before everything goes wrong. Overall, I liked it for what it is that a plane crash goes wrong and has to rescue everyone safely from the rebels. Also, Gerard Butler does not miss with his action films in this one.

The plane is old and there are only a few passengers. One of them is fugitive Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) being transported back to the United States. Lightning strikes during a storm and the plane goes down onto a lawless Philippines island.Realism goes out the window after the lightning strike. I have to say that it's a fun disaster movie for a little while. I expected the plane to land safely. I expected bad CGI. I didn't expected that even the little things are unrealistic silliness. For example, there is no way that Brodie would walk ahead of Louis when the two of them set off on their quest. It doesn't hurt the movie to do it the right way, but they insists on doing the wrong way. I also really hate the cartoon villains. They could be more interesting, but the casting director obviously pulled them out of villains R us. By the time of the Rambo action shootouts, I'm almost giddy from drinking the B-movie Kool-Aid.

237,Plane,Good old fashioned enjoyable action thriller...,6,"Of course I opted to sit down and watch the 2023 action thriller ""Plane"", as I had the opportunity to do so, since Gerard Butler movies tend to be enjoyable.Writers Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis put together an entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And it was one that offered action-packed thrills right from the very beginning. Actually the movie kicks into high gear very early on and never slows down. And that, in my book, definitely makes for some good old fashioned action entertainment.The acting performances in the movie were good, and while it could certainly be said that this is an archetypical Gerard Butler movie, it still makes for some pretty good entertainment. I was genuinely entertained from beginning to end.Aside from Gerard Butler, then the movie also had good performances from the likes of Mike Colter, Tony Goldwyn, Yoson An and Paul Ben-Victor. So there were some familiar faces on the cast list.The action sequences in the movie were well-choreographed and executed on the screen, and that definitely added a lot of enjoyment to the movie.If you enjoy Gerard Butler movies then you will most certainly also enjoy ""Plane"".My rating of director Jean-François Richet's 2023 action thriller ""Plane"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",cours opt sit watch action thriller plane opportun sinc gerard butler movi tend enjoy writer charl cum j p davi put togeth entertain script storylin movi one offer action pack thrill right begin actual movi kick high gear earli never slow book definit make good old fashion action entertain act perform movi good could certainli said archetyp gerard butler movi still make pretti good entertain genuin entertain begin end asid gerard butler movi also good perform like mike colter toni goldwyn yoson paul ben victor familiar face cast list action sequenc movi well choreograph execut screen definit ad lot enjoy movi enjoy gerard butler movi certainli also enjoy plane rate director jean fran oi richet action thriller plane land six ten star
238,Plane,Well-paced action that is fun!,8,"Some movies are meant to have a simple fun time with. No need to try to be more than what they are. Inaccuracies can be ignored since this movie wears its identity on its sleeve. It's the inaccuracies and straight to the point filmmaking that tells the audience that you're in for a good time. Don't take it too seriously.The movie treads familiar territory, although it still feels fresh. The script does a fine job of staying mostly ahead of the viewer. You know generally what to expect, but the plot points that get us to the climax are handled well by not over explaining what's going on. The real life missing flight MH370 is an obvious inspiration for this film (it even name drops the missing plane in the movie). The plane itself is a driving force in the movie's narrative and supports the simple title of Plane. Our pilot hero is the most fresh part of the movie. He is set up as being physically capable of doing what he does, but is also more vulnerable than most action lead's.The pace is almost non-stop, action is easy to follow, and the movie surprisingly does have some heart in the end, which is helped by some fine acting.

241,Plane,"Closer to ""Plain""",5,"""Plane"" is such a lackluster movie with so many parts that seem...missing. You get the sense that there is a more flushed out movie here IF it was shuffled around differently. And that makes for a very frustrating viewing. The trailer pitch seemed to be a these two men on the poster who team to take on baddies. In reality, they spend a small window of time together, but more importantly don't have moments to breathe. A simple solution would be to clue us in on more of the criminal. Yes, much was given away in the trailer. He isn't a bad man. But what we discover as watching is...he isn't even a tough guy at all. Which makes it quite odd to watch him dispatch Filipino separtists (something they mention more times than you care to know). I think it was a mashing of a few cinema tropes. For instance, when the plane does go down, they cut away to the headquarters of Trailblazer Airlines which attempts to do damage control. This is taken from something like ""Under Siege"" or ""Air Force One"". If they were to steal from this, why not make Gerard Butler's character much more...deep. Instead, he isn't made to be very interesting. At some points I found myself asking ""What would Liam Neeson do here?"" Yeah, it falls under that category.So little time is spent on anyone. Or should I say quality time, that even the baddies don't seem that menacing. In fact, they seem sort of...blase about the entire occurrence. Silly as it seems, a local townsperson from a neighboring town actually alerts these jungle warriors into action. And we get a quick idea of their dirty deeds. Which seems so tiresome. This movie is really anemic to what could've made this a solid action flick. Like in when Rambo wrecked revenge on the Burmese militants. That was fun.Here, even Gerard's partner seemed so middling. He even seemed more the speed bump then the man attempting to make himself a good guy. Honestly, I half expected him to sacrifice himself to save the passengers and Gerard would say something clever. Nope. That would elevate this pic into something more fun.It seemed like they just made a very safe film. No heavy lifting. No real stakes. It just is.Now for those who want to see what happens pre-flight, they spend ample time at the beginning of this movie showing all that. To my impatience, I endured it with no reward.I will give them credit. WHEN the first deaths occur, the flight attendant Bonnie (Daniella Pineda) does not wig out. She remains stoic and steely. Something never shown in movies. A woman who doesn't go into hysterics. Chalk it up to trauma or training, I was surprised they chose this route. While refreshing, it would've also been nice to show all the pent up tension release. That would cause the tears to flow. Because she just saw people die. That's been getting on my nerves lately. The fact that this entire flight suffered horrific trauma gave no indication having survived a crash, and then fellow passengers murdered, that they all start cheering when all is well. Man, does that get on my nerves.People should be in shock. If anything, the placement of the merc soldier who says ""You're quite a pilot"" should happen as he steps off the plane and sits on the stairs. There is zero set up and absolutely no payoff.Incidentally, as far as movies that are shot digitally these days, this has to be one of the worst. Brendan Galvin is typically a solid cameraman. I surprised to see how video this looked. But again, I doubt he put up much of a fight when it came to getting this project done. He must've chose the less cumbersome path.

242,Plane,A strictly below average showing!,4,"""Plane""; that's one of the laziest, blandest titles imaginable; I wonder if they were even serious when making the film!The final outcome suggests otherwise.It's one of the most contrived, chaotic (in a bad way) aviation/hostage thrillers I have ever seen. To say the writing is sub-par would just be an understatement.Everything happens all too easily. First, they smoothly crash landed, then the passengers were taken hostage & subsequently got freed with little to no effort. Shortly after the plane took off from the island and went to a nearby landing strip and saves the day (again all too easily) Leaving the audience with no scope to gauge the stakes.Although there were moments in the plot that were supposed to instil feelings of anxiety and dread, but nothing left a lasting impression due to its poor writing & a lazy, ineffective set-up. Even the actors (with paper thin scripts to work with) were incapable of salvaging anything of significance. Now the action isn't half bad, but when you have got nothing else backing it up, plans are bound to come crashing down (pun intended).",plane one laziest blandest titl imagin wonder even seriou make film final outcom suggest otherwis one contriv chaotic bad way aviat hostag thriller ever seen say write sub par would understat everyth happen easili first smoothli crash land passeng taken hostag subsequ got freed littl effort shortli plane took island went nearbi land strip save day easili leav audienc scope gaug stake although moment plot suppos instil feel anxieti dread noth left last impress due poor write lazi ineffect set even actor paper thin script work incap salvag anyth signific action half bad got noth els back plan bound come crash pun intend
243,Plane,Butler always gives his best,7,"Butler is part of a generations of action heroes, perhaps a bit long in the tooth now, who simply do not know how to give a weak performance. There is nothing new about the story, but the pacing is interesting. The director could have turned this into a race, a mistake too many actioners make, trying to constantly hype the audience with new thrills. Instead, the whole film is done more slowly, which in this cases makes the story feel that much more personal. A half hour into it, not a lot has happened but the audience starts to feel like they too are on that plane... and wish they were not. Overall a perfect film to keep you entertained for an overseas flight ... unless of course you have an overactive imagination. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

""Plane"" does not offer anything new, a recycled script full of clichés and predictable scenes, it only becomes interesting during the first minutes in terms of the plane sequences that are reminiscent of disaster genre movies. The performances do their job without any additional merit, plus the director's work seems barely to exist. The cinematography is conventional without any appeal. The soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. The action scenes are bland and in some scenes the digital effects are quite unreal.

245,Plane,"Exactly what you expect, and that's a good thing.",8,"""Plane"" offers exactly what you think it's going to, not straying far-if at all-from familiar action movies like ""Under Siege"" or previous Butler characters like Mike Bannon. It's a well paced movie, roughly broken into 3 acts. But, for me, it's a surprisingly short movie. Just a little over an hour and half. I actually wished there were another 30 minutes to really flesh out the story and the characters, plus adding even more action. Gerard Butler is his usual solid, tough guy self and the addition of of Mike Colter (Luke Cage!) make the movie a really solid action duo. It's a light movie, but doesn't pretend to be something that its not.

246,Plane,A Steven Seagal production?,5,"An FBI agent escorting a murderer who's an ex military, traveling on a plane. In the middle of the Pacific the plane is about to crash due severe weather and mechanical problems. In the worst part of the about-to-crash situation the FBI agent has his cellphone in a hand (Why?). Due the to bumps, the phone drops to the plane floor.A normal personal would hold, wait and keep safe, ignoring the phone, knowing you're not only responsible for your life but for others since you're ESCORTING A MURDERER.But in this movie, the FBI agents removes his seatbelt and goes, against everyone's advice, looking for his phone. A phone that won't do any good since YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC anyhow.What happens next is that the FBI agent is killed after a serious plane's bump. Also a steward is killed trying to sit the FBI agent down.The perfect scene for an audience that spends more time looking at their phones than real life around them. Without a question, that audience will find this scene very relatable.This scene defines the entire movie: All situations in this movie follow that same logic with the adding of drug cartels, a drunk hero pilot who badly needs to shave, annoying passengers who complaint because nobody rescues them in 30 minutes, a low cost airplane company hiring expensive mercenaries, and a long and sad etc.Movie could've been good, but they took it so many steps down so the young (and low IQ) audiences could follow the plot.Steven Seagal's movies are more realistic than this.

250,Shotgun Wedding,Action rom com that is an explosive dud.,4,"2 out of 5 stars.Shotgun Wedding is a bad action romantic comedy film that has a dull plot, lacks the fun humor, and the script offers nothing surprising for its genre. Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Lopez are both great and fun likable actors. Sadly, the script offers nothing new or fun for there characters. The humor is very few in between scenes. Most of the humor it aims for is unfunny. The action is nothing new to the film. The plot is boring. About a couple about to get married on an island only to be crashed by pirates. And occasionally a predictable plot twist that is easily foreshadowed in the beginning. Overall, it is one dull action comedy film that is left alone on that island.",star shotgun wed bad action romant comedi film dull plot lack fun humor script offer noth surpris genr josh duhamel jennif lopez great fun likabl actor sadli script offer noth new fun charact humor scene humor aim unfunni action noth new film plot bore coupl get marri island crash pirat occasion predict plot twist easili foreshadow begin overal one dull action comedi film left alon island

Now I believe there's a reverse trend happening, where people just rate a movie a 8-10 just out of spite / to counter that trend. However, for this movie, you cannot convince me you actually this is worthy of a 8, let alone a 10. The reason I give it a 1 is because there's just a vibe of actings mailing it in for a movie they know was just never going to be good.Jennifer Lopez tries a bit at the beginning, but it's not enough as soon she also cannot help herself to get caught up in the sad reality that this is a cringeworthy bad movie. Script is bad, premise is a bit silly and there's no chemistry between any characters. It honestly feels like an Adam Sandler excretion that he will try to convince you was made with passion and one of his best ones yet.

257,Shotgun Wedding,Big messy fun,7,"It's no Oscar contender folks, and it didn't try to be. It's overall a mixed-bag full of some big laughs but also jokes that fall flat on their face.If you're into romantic comedies you'll find it humorous. I watched it with my boyfriend, mother and sister and we all laughed more than once and stayed entertained up until the end.Jennifer Lopez might as well be put on a stake at this point. Nothing but ""she's such a terrible actress"", ""she can't act out of a bag"", etc. Etc. To find here according to the negative comments. Calm down silly kids; people who can't act don't get continuously cast in leading roles for 30+ years. Sorry, that lame excuse is mute at this point.The chemistry is a bit to be desired between JLo and Josh Duhamel. The latter pulls off some tough scenes that other actors wouldn't have pulled off so smoothly without being so used to this material. I last enjoyed him in the other superior ""Life As We Know It"" off-playing Ms. Katherine Heigl and he does fine here. They have cute moments. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required.Cheech Marin and Jennifer Coolidge are almost in throw away roles, however Ms. Coolidge has had a sudden rise with ""Single All the Way"", ""The White Lotus"" and other very recent shows and movies under her belt. Good for her, and she's having nothing but fun here!! Some stand out scenes are hers alone...Lenny Kravitz is there. That can be a good or bad thing for some people. Like I said, overall a big, messy and fun mixed-bag. Simple plot, beautiful scenery, and a very quick and simple movie.

It's as if all the cast were invited on vacation and just hung out together having a great time with very little concern for making a decent film. Add the usual ""look at how great I am and look"" J-Lo scenes constantly flaunting her mid-life crisis, and there's your film.

I haven't seen Jennifer Lopez in anything for ages and I would now actively avoid watching something if I saw she was in it. She is irritating in this film trying too hard to be dizzy and cute and not achieving anything but annoying. She looks the same age as her mother in law to be. The storyline gets just stupid, not funny, stupid. The main two characters have no chemistry but that's down to Lopez and how she is overacting constantly.

That being said, this movie was far-fetched and completely for entertainment only. The comedy in it was just ok, but the action was on point. It reminded me a bit of Sandra Bullocks movie with Tatum. Now that was a movie I loved! It was so funny, much funnier than this one. So although this was not one of my favorite movies it was also not one I hated. I almost expected the cops to show up at the end when they were lying down in the boat. So, if you like action movies that are crazy and far-fetched then this is a movie for you!

Josh Duhamel and Jennifer definitely had the chemistry going in this film.Basically the film is about a couple (Jennifer and Josh's characters) who are tying the knot on a beautiful island in Asia, paid for by themselves, because he doesn't want her stinking rich father to pay for it.The resort, though beautiful is cheap.. maybe because it is prone to pirate attacks. Something he fails to tell his perspective wife. There is a lot more to it, but I won't add spoilers, sit back and enjoy the ride yourself, you won't be disappointed.Yes, a lot is far fetched.

273,Shotgun Wedding,Dont waste your time,1,"What some so-called actors like Mrs. Affleck, will do for a paycheck and their over fed ego. The producers, director and actors of this overtly contrived piece of RomCon, would in a normal world, be completely embarrassed by such a shamelessly predictable plot and overly phony characterizations. About the only half-way decent thing in viewing this dismal failure is the scenery, shot in the Dominican Republic. If one is really intent on throwing away an hour and forty minutes of their life on this bad piece of cinema, one would be doing themselves a favor by muting the sound and reading the closed caption.

274,Your Place or Mine,Can we have more Witherspoon but in a better film? [+40%],4,"This one stays watchable thanks to a bright, buoyant-as-always Reese Witherspoon, but the writing and direction are on auto-pilot. For a film that pretentiously begins in 2003 and ends in 2023, there's very little actual romance or comedy here that grabs your sustained attention. The film just plods along in a familiar ""can best friends turn lovers?"" setup, the payoff of which is so minuscule and very 2003-like. Sure, it's not a film you'd ditch half-way, yet it has nothing that warrants a revisit - as is the case with most Netflix ""originals."" Also, a film like this would have actually benefited from having Kutcher and Witherspoon in the same space (to hell with those split-screens) a lot longer than 5 minutes tops.

Not much comedy, not much chemistry between the main character due to their distance.

276,Your Place or Mine,"Sadly, not good",2,"First off, I really, really like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" which I've watched repeatedly. This is the same writer.""Your Place"" to me is just facile and lazy writing. During the first hour, I kept debating whether to stick with it. Since there was nothing else on, and I was tired from the workweek, I did. When Jesse Williams (from Grey's Anatomy) showed up, I perked up because, well, it's Jesse Williams! The movie did start to move a little faster then. Faster but not better.There's no real tension in the movie until the last scene, which feels tacked on just so there can be a climactic ""I hate you, no - I love you!"" scene. Everyone gets what they want effortlessly. Want a top NYC editor to read your friend's book? Both he and his assistant read it overnight and of course, want to publish it. Debbie/Reese is taking a graduate class but never has to study. Want your friend's kid to be on the hockey team? Even though his mom hasn't let him play hockey, he makes it on the first try.It's a lot of telling, not showing. We're told they've had this 20 year best friendship, but we don't see anything that would lead us to think that. We're told they fell in love the first night, but we don't see it.I think because I already have good will towards Reese and Ashton, I automatically root for them from the top to the extent that I care, which isn't much.Zoe Chao is the one really funny character, but that may be more the actor than the writing. I was happy to see Steve Zahn but then his character was just dumb. The young actor playing Jack was very good. I didn't like it, though, when Jack was given preternatural insight for his age.There's no actual comedy, except for Zoe Chao. Maybe if the writer had rewritten it a bunch of times and made the dialogue better.

277,Your Place or Mine,Pleasant but Forgettable Rom-Com with Capable Cast,6,"A standard romantic comedy that takes place in 2003. Directed by writer Aline Brosh McKenna, who has written many popular romantic comedies, including ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" the film is a typical feel-good movie that is good for a lazy day on Netflix. Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher star as Debbie and Peter, who have been best friends for 20 years. They are opposites, with different lifestyles and personalities, and the movie follows their journey as they switch homes for a week. While the two lead actors are good-looking and charismatic, the film is let down by its bland script and lack of depth.

However by the time you're in your 40s and you're still saying this it's kind of pathetic. Movies like this work better for characters in their 20s that have been friends since they were kids. The movie was generic, boring and predictable. Tig Notaro plays an interesting side character they both apparently have known for years but with no backstory as to how. Steve Zahn plays a silly gardener they attempt to utilize as comedy but really just comes off as a pointless character and quite frankly a waste of Steve's time. She briefly has an affair with a dude she has no chemistry with and like no other rom-com before (great sarcasm here) they kiss and make up at baggage claim in an airport after confessing their love for one another only a whopping 20 years later.

Plus, best friends-to-lovers trope always works on me. It is refreshing to see romance movie that two main characters do not spend much time together physically, but audience can sense their friendship has been strong partly because they have been friends to us millennial for a long time as well.

287,Your Place or Mine,Justice for Minka!,6,"This movie was good and cute. Nothing great by far; but for a directorial debut the motions are gone through and it works. Like other comments mention there is a lot left to be desired.Strong points: The soundtrack? Phenomenal. I see little to no one mentioning it and it's worth mentioning. Lots of classics, cool mellow tunes that go with the movie's flow and I couldn't help notice every time one came on I felt a great sense of like they knew what they were doing. (My dad loved The Cars.)Reese Witherspoon is of course a treat to be delighted in. She claims her scenes with ease. Zoe Chao as Minka was the comedic relief the movie needed to break it's ice for me, however. She is HILARIOUS. I love the character, love the actress and her portrayal. It's all too much. ""I smell dead people..."" *dies laughing* Every time she came on screen I smiled.The downsides: The movie has a very meandering pace. There's a lot of content with not really much to say. Nothing big really goes on. Like I said it all just going through the motions even if it does it well. It's all a character development and how they play off each other. Steve Zahn and Ashton Kutcher don't bring as much as they could but I guess their characters are slightly less under written.If Minka starred in her own movie I would definitely watch it. That's how much I loved her.Anyway, a very soft thumbs up. 6/10 stars.

The film also portrays very clean, orderly, almost antiseptic New York and Los Angeles which border on surreal.This film is like an after dinner coffee and chocolate; a relaxing, comfortable morsel but hardly main course stuff.

292,Your Place or Mine,No Chemistry,5,"The film was a delightful and charming movie that left a smile on my face. The humor was well-timed and the story was cute and engaging. Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon both delivered strong performances, bringing their unique comedic styles to the film. However, despite their undeniable talent, there was no real spark or chemistry between the two lead actors. This lack of chemistry was a bit of a letdown as it detracted from the overall romantic atmosphere of the film.

293,Your Place or Mine,Bad chemistry that fails as a rom com.,4,"2 out of 5 stars.Your Place or Mine is a bad romantic comedy film that not only is predictable with its plot but falls flat with the two main characters Reece Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher. There performances are flat with there characters. The chemistry is tedious. About two best friends switched places for a week. The story is forgettable. The acting is stale. It is a difficult romantic film to even care for the characters. I did find the film to be forgettable and boring. The script also was also lacking the development in putting any depths with the characters.

Strangely, it has Midwestern touches, less LA or NY as the mentioned cities.First of all, this is Ashton's walk in park. Just smile and be an eye candy of a man. Despite showing acting versatility, Ashton seemed out of place and taking it too easy. Practically, any actor coukd play his character.Reese was at home, playing neurotic and overprotective mother. It's not an acting challenge at all for her.Zoé Chao stole the attention with her sparkly character and city gal charm. Although, her character was written way too well-like at the end.The chemistry was way off. Yes, they looked like 2 best friends. But both didn't show the eye language of 2 people in love with each other, good friend but no love.

295,Your Place or Mine,Nope. Save your time,3,"Contains spoliersSo, the movie starts off very slow and boring and then is super rushed at the end. Both the main characters careers aren't explained it's not really a love story but is at the same time. Ashton doesn't realize that he's fallen in love with Reese until the last 30 minutes and at the end of the movie he's like ""I've been in love with you forever"" they aren't compatible and there isn't any chemistry. There are multiple jokes in the movie that don't really land.

298,Your Place or Mine,Stars do not make a good movie,4,"I love most of the actors that are in this film. My husband and I enjoy romcoms. We literally look for new ones to watch. But this is the second new streamer-produced romcom we've seen lately that flops. Honestly, Prime's Shotgun Wedding is worse. We couldn't even finish that one.No wonder the streamers are losing money. It's not just about the stars. It's not about the premise. It's about the writing and directing. In the case of Your Place or Mine, I agree with other reviewers that this is a poor use of Reese Witherspoon's talents. It's true of the other actors, as well.Netflix and others need to look past the premise and the stars and READ the script before green-lighting. If they had, perhaps they'd have noted that it's disjointed, not particularly funny, and that the characters themselves aren't at all real. There is no depth or logic to any of the characters. It doesn't have to be a lot for a romcom!The leads are both supposed to be inherently creative types. She is supposed to be a repressed editor.Ashton Kutcher is supposed to be a clandestine writer and avid reader. Yet, his apartment is barren. Even his books are on the shelf by color, presumably decorated by a professional designer. He is revealed to be a marketing consultant who can't commit to a company nor to a woman. Marketing is often a creative career, and I don't know a single marketing person who would have an apartment like what they portray for him. That apartment would suit a techie, perhaps, or, indeed, a math whiz. The Porsche works, and his sense of humor work. The fact that he reads a lot works. But that's it. His character isn't complete. Kutcher does the best he can with this, but it just doesn't connect.Reese's character is supposed to be like an old hippie. Long skirts, jean jackets, bohemian. Her house fits that. However, the screenwriter has her in a completely nonsensical career in math. Math? She reads voraciously. She was probably an English major in college. We don't really know if she's ever edited, but it's what she wants to do, just doesn't think it's practical. Why did the writer put her in some kind of math class? And for what job? That's never revealed that I saw. Why wasn't SHE in marketing for a career? Sales, even? Those and others would make more sense than some indistinct job in math for everything else about her character. Plus all of her week-long shenanigans in LA wouldn't have given her time to study to actually pass a test. Is she naturally a math wiz? I didn't see the evidence in her personality as written.No, romcoms aren't typically in-depth. But the good ones do better than this. The best in class is When Harry Met Sally. It not only had good acting, but an excellent script for them to work with.And, in good romcoms, there is chemistry. I didn't see that among any of the characters. It was as if they were all independently floating through the movie, especially Steve Zahn's character of the neighbor. What exactly was the point of his character? The only character with any depth was the kid, Wesley Kimmel, and his scenes were fun. This was also a poor use of Tig Notaro. She's naturally funny, and some of her lines worked. But again, no depth, no engagement.Netflix, stop scrimping on writing. If a new writer needs a chance, at least get someone with more experience to help them hone good, worthy scripts.

Ginger Snaps in particular says hello throughout, there are echoes of When Animals Dreams, which is actually a decent Scandinavian coming of age cum werewolf movie. A chaste and sanitized ghost of American Werewolf in London is somewhere in there, too.There's a bit of teenage family drama thrown in, there's young love, both of which don't take the story anywhere.The dialogue is very bad, the production bland, the overall look is that of a minor TV movie.

Near the end he drives full throttle in a store front where the werewolf stands. A man that was established as a hunter that hunts werewolf for all his life. Confronts the werewolf unprepared. As if.

304,Viking Wolf,Viking Wolf,7,"As this Norwegian film opens we are told how, almost a thousand years ago, Viking raiders heading south to Normandy. In a monastery they find a fearsome wolf like 'hell hound'. They take it with them as they return... none of the Vikings survive and the creature swims ashore. In the present day teenage girl Thale, and her family, have just moved to the remote Norwegian town where her mother, Liv, has joined the local police. One evening Thale sneaks out of her house to attend a beach party. Another girl is attacked and dragged off by a creature, Thale is scratched. Liv leads the investigation and soon finds what appears to be a wolf's claw. When the body is found it appears to have been attacked by a large, savage animal. An eccentric hunter turns up claiming the creature is in fact a werewolf!I thought this was a decent enough addition to the werewolf genre. The prologue made it clear that this was going to be a werewolf film from the opening scene. Part of me would have preferred that information to come out a bit later but it didn't matter too much as it wasn't long before we knew what had attacked the girl. Apart from explaining how werewolves originally came to be in Scandinavia it didn't try to add anything to the established lore. The plot borrows from other films; most obviously 'An American Werewolf in London' but also from less obvious sources... I'm sure the hunter was inspired by Quint from 'Jaws'. The effects are decent enough and the acting was solid. The big question about any horror film is 'Is it scary?' unfortunately for the most part it isn't. While we see a bit of the aftermath of attacks the makers seemed a bit squeamish about showing the gory attacks. Overall a decent enough addition to the genre that fans of werewolf movies are likely to enjoy. Even if they don't rate it amongst the best they are unlikely to consider it one of the worst.These comments are based on watching the film in Norwegian with English subtitles.",norwegian film open told almost thousand year ago vike raider head south normandi monasteri find fearsom wolf like hell hound take return none vike surviv creatur swim ashor present day teenag girl thale famili move remot norwegian town mother liv join local polic one even thale sneak hous attend beach parti anoth girl attack drag creatur thale scratch liv lead investig soon find appear wolf claw bodi found appear attack larg savag anim eccentr hunter turn claim creatur fact werewolf thought decent enough addit werewolf genr prologu made clear go werewolf film open scene part would prefer inform come bit later matter much long knew attack girl apart explain werewolv origin came scandinavia tri add anyth establish lore plot borrow film obvious american werewolf london also less obviou sourc sure hunter inspir quint jaw effect decent enough act solid big question horror film scari unfortun part see bit aftermath attack maker seem bit squeamish show gori attack overal decent enough addit genr fan werewolf movi like enjoy even rate amongst best unlik consid one worst comment base watch film norwegian english subtitl

I couldn't feel any love in the movie, regardless the family one not the fancy one. The university lecturer/ vet seemed more like a junior lab tech. Expert, seriously?

308,Viking Wolf,Wonder Woman v The Werewolf,4,"Anyone with only a basic understanding of folklore knows if a victim survives a werewolf bite, well, beware the next full moon. As the body count mounts, including a bus-load of passengers either mauled or killed by the beast, there are no extra police brought in at any time, even after hunters, a press photographer, an asylum seeker, and the police chief are torn to shreds. By the way, the big burly police chief can't stomach the medical examination of the first victim, leaving the female coroner and the female cop to poke through the remains. He is scared witless in the woods upon seeing a corpse and instructs the female cop to take charge of the hunt. The animal expert sent to examine the bodies looks as though he is still going through puberty.The female mayor is held back from seeing what's left of her daughter's mangled body yet recovers quickly enough to give a chirpy little speech to the townsfolk. A grizzled old man who knows all about werewolves drives his truck through a big glass window and almost kills the vet and the cop who were holding it closed. The cop's house-husband is left bleeding and slumped over the wheel of his car.....he is never seen or heard of again......
The most risible scene must be when the wolf has the cop pinned to the ground, it's massive fangs sink deep into the flesh and bone of her arm, it's jaws gnawing down on the limb and in a sort of conversational way, she calls out to the vet for help. Very soon she is driving home, both arms intact and able to hang up her coat, despite the fact one arm had been broken in her first brush with the wolf earlier on in the film.Also, what of those bitten but survived?

310,Viking Wolf,Damn those Vikings!,4,"The title Viking Wolf basically reveals everything you need to know about this movie. Greedy vikings back in the day released a hound from hell which made it's way into the Nordic woods. Cut to the present time, it continues to wreck havoc by attacking annoying teenagers. Barring the initial hype created with the Vikings scene, the story follows the routine narrative wrt werewolf movies. A family which has newly moved into the small town and the rebellious teen daughter being her annoying best to be rude to her mom and new step dad. There's a deaf sister too who for the plot's sake only becomes relevant in the final act and ofcourse the mother is a cop.Netflix got me intrigued enough to watch this one due to the trending. Anyways it was indeed a predictable age old werewolf movie, just that this one is Norwegian. There were several convenient plot points throughout cutting the tension. It is less gory too compared to other similar films. What I did enjoy was the final act especially the scene on the bus which is why I am going with a lenient rating. If they had explored more of the daughter's character and her equation with her mother then the end result could have been better.

I want to be honest and say this review is based on how much I did watch.Some great movies have come out of Norway but this is certainly not one of them. The title alone is a misrepresentation of what the movie is actually about.If it was called ""Moody Teenager"" it would be much closer to the reality if what this movie is.The acting by the main part of the cast is just awful. Their pacing is so off it's like one person delivers a line and then someone who replies has to wait 30 seconds. Not for tension. Just normal conversation.

313,Viking Wolf,Was worth watching...,5,"I start out by saying that I like watching movies from other countries as they often have actors and filming locations that I've never seen. It does make it harder to evaluate the acting as you don't know if something you don't like is bad acting, bad direction or more a reflection of the culture the actor comes from. I say that as I liked the movie but found most of the characters subdued and not very friendly at any time in the movie. So I'd want more character and emotions but that might not be a Norwegian trait.The movie does derive from other werewolf movies but I still found parts of it fresh. I thought the modern approach to werewolves was better then most of what I've seen lately.There are plot holes as with any movie but I didn't really notice many until it was over. Although the crashing RV seemed out of the blue. And how do citizens get to crime scenes faster than other police?I like the ending, not only for its potential, or not, twist but also had the feeling that the police officer/mother was coming home to an empty house.Not a movie that you'll likely watch again in the near future but worth a watch now.",start say like watch movi countri often actor film locat never seen make harder evalu act know someth like bad act bad direct reflect cultur actor come say like movi found charact subdu friendli time movi want charact emot might norwegian trait movi deriv werewolf movi still found part fresh thought modern approach werewolv better seen late plot hole movi realli notic mani although crash rv seem blue citizen get crime scene faster polic like end potenti twist also feel polic offic mother come home empti hous movi like watch near futur worth watch

The Norwegian actors and scenery are a refreshing change from so many of the current films online and it gets your interest quickly and turns into an exciting thriller and I never felt let down.

315,Viking Wolf,Like a mangy dog,1,"Really silly, cliched werewolf movie. It's all there - the miserable teenage daughter (played by an actress who looks around 25) who is all angsty because her mother married again, the cute little sister who is a mute, the female police chief who goes all feminine and helpless at times of crisis. And the horribly fake-looking CGI wolf, although it is at least marginally better than the plastic dog in ""Gingersnaps"". Then there is the ""expert veterinarian"" (who looks about 14) who turns out to be an expert in werewolves too, and the gnarled old hunter with the funny accent who has been trying to eliminate ""the curse"" forever, yet is completely unprepared when he meets the wolf face to face. And don't let's forget the two men who are guarding a body in the woods; they are both armed to the teeth, but when the wolf shows up they just stand there looking at it until it kills them.Really, really bad - don't waste your time.

316,Viking Wolf,Dog Bite,5,"I can see how some reviews comparing the film to a cluster of other horror films with bits and pieces sawn up together to make up the ""Vikinggulven"". Some may disagree but, I personally think that having been inspired by other films is not the problem until it becomes imitational. And it is not what happened in this film.Although the subject matter- werewolf is beaten to death through the past 5 decades, almost all possible ploys are consumed and endings feel like regurgitations of the same. Take for example a similar topic of zombies. The 1st zombie movie that has ever been made believed to be directed by Victor Halperin named ""White Zombie"" in 1936. However, the worldwide introduction of this particular spectacle is achieved by the director George A. Romero with the release of ""Night of the Living Dead"" in 1968. Since then according to Wikipedia, over 570 zombie-themed movies were released by the end of 2021.Accordingly, motion pictures that are made with the same brand of themes are similar in architecture, ambiance, character design, dialogs, and monologs as well as spaces (cities or small towns, forests or underground places, etc)Nonetheless, it is not unexpected for viewers to find similarities in this film and the others when a topic is so exhaustingly used up. However, the acting is ok, directing good, the writing is standard and CGI is good for a small-budget film. However, it's predictable, forgettable yet watchable.My suggestions for the writers and directors as well as wannabes create a new object and objective. Give it a few similar yet quite unfamiliar traits. Use your imagination. Don't give people what they want.

I even skipped watching it's trailer so to enjoy the movie without knowing anything about it.The problems are plenty here, 1st is the movie isn't even sure what it wants to be either a horror or a drama and succeeds in neither department. You don't feel about any character. You just wait and wait for things to happen bt nothing.. only in the last 30 minutes does the movie picks some pace. And no it's not a slowburner or anything like that, just plain irritating to this point. Performances are okay, nothing exceptional. The problem is you don't watch these movies for performances or decent story , you just wanna have some silly fun and spend the time. You won't believe that there's is almost no violence and gore in this supposed to be ""werewolf"" movie. And coming to the actual ""werewolf"" of this movie the lesser we talk about it is better, it looks like something from a low budget video game.

But after watching the first minutes, I realized this nearly as an 1:1-copy of 'Ginger snaps' (alas 10 mins schorter). I'm the guy who doesn't like remakes, because they are most of the time a poor impression of the original movie. So there have to be some extraordinary special effects or surprising turns to make that movie worth it's money. Yeah, there are some good CGIs and ambitioned actors, thats why I gave two stars. But using the same plot and only giving the main character (which also looks the same as Ginger) two eye colors doesn't qualify as an independent movie.

323,Viking Wolf,It's about time ...,10,"The problem with the werewolf films is they generally fail to stand up to the well known . That's usually a budget issue, resulting in a poor script, average acting, so so directing and the lack of the money shot -- the obligatory transformation scene. Basically, you can usually see the money running out as the film progresses, leaving no bite for the third act.Enter Netflix, it would seem their pockets are deep enough to make a worthy addition with Vikinggulven (Viking Wolf). Actually, this is a surprisingly good addition to the genre, a perfectly fine plot which wasn't too caught up in subterfuge, which is usually a bad sign in werewolf films, so no guessing as to who the wolf protagonist is, just tension as to when they will figure it out for themselves so we can start with the real fun ... the wolf.Excellent CGI has been around for nearly 30 years now. First of all dinosaurs, then meteors and space aliens, but they still didn't have the rendering skill to produce hair, and those wolves in the late 90's through the early 2000's didn't really look right unless there was a mix of traditional effects and CGI. However, now they've got that one down even for lower medium budget films, and the wolves are acceptable enough. This one was well conceived, the transformation scene and the resultant animal is good enough to pass the test.The rest of it: a reasonably decent plot, good acting and a perfectly fine job by the director leads to a suitable third act for any werewolf film buff with plenty of blood and guts and many minutes of onscreen wolfery which should satisfy even the genres most ardent critics.Of course, there will always be those that require levels of perfection that even Netflix budgets won't deliver, hence the propensity to score 1/10, which should only really be given in dire and rare circumstances though I see it all the time, even with even big budget movies that can't be scored less than a 5/10 (= watchable in my book). So to balance that out, I will be scoring 10 for everything that I think is worth more than a 5/10 - hence my official score for this is a 10, though I think I would have scored 8 in reality.Whatever the case, give it a shot.

324,Blood,A new poker tell for reviews,6,"A hit and a miss. Michelle Monaghan is great. A decade ago, you could find her in literally every romcom coming out of Tinseltown, playing the love interest on the distaff side. Props to her for successfully maintaining a career in drama films like this one, films that rely entirely on acting chops. And Brad Anderson has forgotten more about sci-fi than most creators today actually know, another veteran. Blood is an eponymous title, and yes the viewers get what they pay for. But, acting aside, the story is not satisfying and the characters continually make bad choices -- which can be distressing for theater patrons expecting a fun ride. Notice also the new metric for the reviews -- count the number of fake-tens that the producers use to salt the early ratings, and that shows you the confidence that the studio has in its own product.

The acting only made me watch the film because it is pointless and pretty slow as well.

For a B-grade cinema, this is quite an interestingly developed plot of supporting characters. The biggest drawback is probably that it's not very scary. On the plus side, there is a slight suggestion at the end of the film that maybe we didn't quite see the same thing as the main character, but I think it's more of an attempt by the medical services to justify the phenomenon in general.

332,Blood,Michelle Monaghan in one the most disturbing film ever,4,"I loved THE MACHINIST but was mixed by BLOOD. The film has great elements, first Michelle Monaghan is phenomenal and her performance is really great, engaging as a mother who is ready to literally everything to support and heal his child. Also the two children are every great. The script is far from being flawless, but is full of suspense, tension and strong relationships between the characters.BLOOD is also one of the most disturbing film you'll ever see. It can be disgusting at moments, though there is no gore (but lots of, well, blood, in this film. What's unhealthy, and really disturbing is the character's decisions and actions, and Monaghan's character, just like us, knows from the very beginning that what she's doing is wrong. She can be seen as a mother who loves and cherishes her child, and also, as someone says in the movie, ""a monster"". That's really disturbing. And her actions become unbelievable at some points. Of course, the supernatural element here is only a pretext to think about: ""how far would you fo for your child?"".Still, there is a feeling that something is unfinished here, probably due due to some unanswered questions, but we feel it goes beyond these.BLOOD is a film you'll love or hate. What's sure is that you'll probably feel very uncomfortable, and be shocked watching this film.

336,Blood,"Watchable, but somewhat boring actually...",4,"When I stumbled upon this 2022 horror/thriller titled ""Blood"", I must admit that I wasn't initially impressed with the movie's cover. But with it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to find the time to sit down and watch it.Writer Will Honley churned out a semi-adequate script for the movie. There were some interesting aspects to the storyline, for sure. However, the narrative was just too slow paced and there simply wasn't enough of things happening throughout the course of the 108 minutes to keep it all that thrilling and interesting actually. So director Brad Anderson just didn't really have all that much of a proper script to work with really.The acting performances in ""Blood"" were fair enough, taking into consideration the limitations imposed on the actresses and actors.Visually then you're not in for anything outstanding. But then again, ""Blood"" wasn't a movie that really relied heavily on having special effects. So the lack of impressive and bedazzling effects wasn't really a hindrance to the movie.While I managed to sit through the entire movie, I have to admit that ""Blood"" just didn't have the stuff that mattered, and that made it a somewhat boring movie to sit through, especially since it took director
Brad Anderson forever to set the stage for the final 15 minutes of the movie.My rating of ""Blood"" lands on a generous four out of ten stars.",stumbl upon horror thriller titl blood must admit initi impress movi cover horror movi alreadi seen cours opt find time sit watch writer honley churn semi adequ script movi interest aspect storylin sure howev narr slow pace simpli enough thing happen throughout cours minut keep thrill interest actual director brad anderson realli much proper script work realli act perform blood fair enough take consider limit impos actress actor visual anyth outstand blood movi realli reli heavili special effect lack impress bedazzl effect realli hindranc movi manag sit entir movi admit blood stuff matter made somewhat bore movi sit especi sinc took director brad anderson forev set stage final minut movi rate blood land gener four ten star
337,Blood,I didn't like it.,4,"Too many things wrong with this film. The film never reveals the secrets of the tree. Jess, as. Helen said, is a total monster. She is a bigger monster than what her son has become. She has a drug problem, ruined her marriage, neglects her children and takes her kids away from the other parent that is capable of providing care for them. Despite this, she is given custody of her two children because she is the mother.When her son becomes sick with an unexplained illness that turns him into a vampire like creature after he is bitten by the infected family pet, she hides his illness from the doctors in the hospital she works in. Out of her own selfishness and ego , she decides to feed her child human blood which she knows is unsustainable. At first, she illegally obtains the blood from the hospital's freezer that stores blood for patients, then animal blood from rabbits she purchased at a pet store, she feeds her son her own blood until that also isn't sustainable, then she kidnaps a terminally ill elderly woman who only has 6 months to live from an undisclosed cancer. She robs the poor elderly woman from her few days of life to satisfy her motherly ego by drawing her blood to feed her son.. She knows this will eventually end with the death of the old woman and she traumatizes her daughter with her decisions. Her son dies anyway but with a ton of collateral damage in her wake. Again, Helen said it best, Jes is a monster. The boy might have lived if given proper medical care.The flick is a vampire film without the ""vampire"". It reminded me a little of ""Let the Right One In (2008)"" in which in that film, a caretaker for the vampire kills and brings back blood for a young-looking girl that is hundreds of year-old vampire. But again, here, the film doesn't go into vampire lore. But it's the same concept of feeding a blood thirsty monster.I didn't like the film because I found the character, Jess, reprehensible and the story wasn't fleshed out well. The story of the tree is never revealed so we are left with nothing. The ending seems to imply or leave room for a possible sequel when the story seems to repeat itself with a new family pet that is at the brink of becoming infected. But this time the three has been burnt down. I really hope there isn't a sequel. This film was a waste of time. It felt like it would be a good film. Almost felt like an A24 horror in the beginning.

338,Blood,It's better than what many reviews rate,10,"Michelle Monaghan is one of my favorites. It's unusual (for me) to see her in a role like this- part monster and all mother. I suppose every mother could potentially become a monster in order to protect her kid.The movie is indeed a horror. It begins as a drama and develops as a thriller, eventually it results in horror. I liked the pace, although I found myself easily distracted early on.

345,Blood,Woefully anemic,4,"Examining Brad Anderson's back catalog, it's almost heretical to state that Blood is in desperate need of thrills. This is a guy that has given us the likes of The Machinist, TransSiberian or Session 9 - all competent, albeit disposable genre fares. Anderson is clearly trying to capitalize on his strengths here - the moody and evocative cinematography, simple yet relatable themes, and committed performances from his leads - but they never coalesce into something consistently engaging. The trailer is probably the most rousing aspect of this picture - a masterclass of false advertising promising a gloomy, vampiric take on a child gone bad and containing most of the movie's memorable scenes. Yet the final product is more Room than The Good Son, a plodding tale of a loving mother that is too languid and ludicrous to sustain any kind of dramatic heft. Much like the child she nourishes, it's an insipid piece that only sporadically springs to life - and it will take more than a few pints of blood to fix.",examin brad anderson back catalog almost heret state blood desper need thrill guy given us like machinist transsiberian session compet albeit dispos genr fare anderson clearli tri capit strength moodi evoc cinematographi simpl yet relat theme commit perform lead never coalesc someth consist engag trailer probabl rous aspect pictur masterclass fals advertis promis gloomi vampir take child gone bad contain movi memor scene yet final product room good son plod tale love mother languid ludicr sustain kind dramat heft much like child nourish insipid piec sporad spring life take pint blood fix

348,Infiesto,Flat and exploitative,5,"The plot follows the investigative police thriller style. We accompany detectives Samuel and Castro around the municipality of Piloña, Spain, in their investigation. However, the plot itself is simple and devoid of twists. Its linearity becomes an issue when we reach the climax.Part of the premise is that the investigation takes place at the time of the COVID pandemic, but that doesn't affect the plot. The pandemic is just a backdrop to the plot, present but indifferent. The plot tries to place the pandemic as a relevant factor, to the point of counting the days of confinement at the time when curfews and quarantines came into effect worldwide; the pandemic context seems to be just an artifice to attract an audience; the plot would remain the same without the pandemic.In the end, the feeling is one of exploitation, a twist that feels forced. Nothing in the plot indicates that that would be the end, the plot just plays a trick, an Ex-Machina that connects all the points, leaving us with the bitter taste of disassociation. The insinuations, the theories, all falls flat.The name of the film can only be premeditated. Infest.With a linear and simplistic plot, marked by a meaningless and calculated twist, and appropriating a historical moment that does not interfere with the plot, Infiesto should only be proud of its sepia cinematography of a decrepit Spanish region.

349,Infiesto,Noir Covid Thriller,8,"Infiesto: What at the outset looks like a film about a serial killer/kidnapping ring morphs into a Spanish Folk Horror thriller. It begins in march 2020 just as the covid lockdowns were first implemented. A girl who has been missing for nearly 3 months suddenly turns up. She has escaped from her abductors but is traumatised, remembers little. Two detectives who themselves are suffering from family separation due to the quarantines and curfews investigate the case and soon connect it to other missing young people. Strange characters are encountered and the obvious assumption is that a people trafficking gang is at work. But strange symbols are observed and the words of suspects suggest that a Cult with a hidden leader is involved. Sacrifices to appease an Old God, the coming of The End Times are all in the mix with the pandemic itself. The Asturias mountains where the detectives hunt for the Cult members and their victims provide a stark and eerie background. From old farm barns through the woods and pursuit along narrow roads, Cultists determined not to be taken alive must be pursued. Quite violent and gory in parts but much of the horror is psychological. This film could have been fleshed out and would have benefited from a twenty minute extension to it's 97 minute running time.

351,Infiesto,Failed thriller,3,"Infiesto is s small mining town in the province of Asturias, in northwest Spain. The time is the end of winter, a dark, rainy, melancholic season. The lead characters are Inspector Samuel (male) and Subinspector Castro (female). The movie opens with the roadside appearance of a teenager, alive, kidnapped long ago and presumed dead.The first half is rather good; it shows routine police work with frustrating leads, abundance of dead ends and uncooperative witnesses. It also shows in passing the heavy industry that pollutes the air and defiles the verdant, idyllic landscapes of Asturias with open pits, denuded hillsides and smokestacks.However, the story veers midway into horror movie territory. Improbabilities and impossibilities pile up and, what could have been a good police procedural slides into the (unintentionally) funny. Direction, cinematography and acting are good, but they can's cope with the material. The time frame of the action is the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and this is brought into play but is mostly inessential to the action.I was intrigued by the choice of a town with the strange name Infiesto.

Inspectors Garcia and Castro are ordered to find out what really happened, as each of them has personal issues as well (Garcia's mom and Castro's boyfriend are isolated due to the coronavirus). At this point we are 10 minutes in the film...Couple of comments: this is a cop drama set in the remote and rugged Asturias region in northwest Spain. No sunshine here! Just industrial, gloomy and never-ending low hanging clouds. Add on top of that dealing with the coronavirus AND investigating the mysterious disappearance of various young people, and it all leads up to a gritty police drama. I quite liked it, to be honest. I wasn't familiar with anyone of the cast or the production team. The two leads, Isak Ferriz (as Garcia) and Sandra Bullock-reminding Iria Del Rio (as Castro), mesh well together without going over the top. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about that, the better.

356,Skinamarink,I really tried,5,"I went into this movie completely blind (as I try to do with most movies) and can say without question this is NOT a movie you want to go in blind. This movie is extremely experimental and abstract and will not be to most people's taste. The entire film is shot with a grainy vhs type look and is comprised of deliberately off center shots of the interior of a house. There is virtually no plot to speak of and most of the 1 hour 40 minute runtime is composed of random shots.I love films that challenge and are demanding to the viewer. I love independent cinema and slow burn films. But this film expects WAY too much from the viewer and becomes very irritating as a result. Even to the hardened art house viewer this movie expects too much. This would have made a brilliant 40 minute short as there are moments of true horror but they are surrounded by random repetitive imagery. At no point does this movie pick up pace or have any sort of narrative.This movie feels like a nightmare ASMR or a full length creepy pasta. If you suffered from night terrors or sleep paralysis or experienced childhood trauma I think you could become extremely invested in this film and that is the only way this works. I didn't feel connected or engaged in the story (I've never been through any of the above) and the only film I can compare with regards to the pacing and somnolent effect this movie had is ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"".Five points for originality.",went movi complet blind tri movi say without question movi want go blind movi extrem experiment abstract peopl tast entir film shot graini vh type look compris deliber center shot interior hous virtual plot speak hour minut runtim compos random shot love film challeng demand viewer love independ cinema slow burn film film expect way much viewer becom irrit result even harden art hous viewer movi expect much would made brilliant minut short moment true horror surround random repetit imageri point movi pick pace sort narr movi feel like nightmar asmr full length creepi pasta suffer night terror sleep paralysi experienc childhood trauma think could becom extrem invest film way work feel connect engag stori never film compar regard pace somnol effect movi beyond black rainbow five point origin

359,Skinamarink,I feel like this was my Jacob's Ladder and I'm still stuck watching it,2,"The first feature film from director and writer Kyle Edward Ball -- he's also made a proof of concept for this movie named Heck and the video for Craig Moreau's ""It Aint Nuthin'"" -- Skinamarink finds its origins in Bitesized Nightmares, a YouTube channel started by Ball that visualized nightmares contributed by commenters.Shot in the Edmonton, Alberta home that Ball grew up in for $15,000, this has all the buzz of a major debut. And that fine, as it has a definite feel for the weirdness that is within the darkness and long hallways and how terrifying it is to be a child. But then it just goes on and on, with arty shots of Lego blocks and upside down rooms and people with no faces played over cartoon soundtracks and hiss and static.There's no narrative here and the idea that keeps getting pushed -- ""Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished."" -- would not be easy to find unless you knew it going in.It's the kind of film that would wow your film school professor at ten minutes but at 100 minutes, this is the kind of movie that has one frightening thing: looking to see how much time is left throughout the film and feeling like more time keeps getting added and you must push yourself like some kind of marathon runner just to endure its endless repetitive layer images and noise-filled audio.This is a movie filled with jump cuts for people above jump cuts but who can proclaim it as cinema.This is a movie for people to feel good about themselves for liking it and being ahead of people who ""just don't get it"" (see We're All Going to the World's Fair).This is a movie where people will tweet about how it changed them and they can't shake its darkness but it's all just words like fever dream, slow burn and takes chances which are just Film Twitter words that really are sound and fury signifying nothing.Just imagine: You put a whole bunch of quiet scenes together, then turn on the lights and get loud. Of course everyone screams.Much like the worst of elevated horror, it all goes back to bad parenting. I mean, those Legos aren't going to clean themselves up. ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is a cartoon from the past which is very hit the nail on the head in this. And I really dislike the fake grain and pops added to this, like something out of that fake grindhouse trend a few years ago.The real terror within this movie is just like how Host won't stop replicating as inferior Zoom horror movies, I'll be sent so many movies next year that just stare at an old toy for an hour while someone plays an xylophone in the background and makes coffee, but shot on an old PXL2000 camera and a Casio soundtrack. Get ready for so many press releases that start with ""Influenced by Skinamarink.""I think that Ball has something in him as this movie sets up some interesting things and then never delivers on them. It's just waiting for the next scare, almost like a deconstructed horror film that's above simple scares yet uses them repeatedly. He said about this movie, ""Shooting a movie in the house you grew up in about two characters that are more or less you and your sister, I didn't have to try to make it more personal-it just sort of happened. And then an added benefit was my mom had saved a bunch of childhood toys that we used in the movie, so it got even more personal.""I'd like to see that movie, because I have no idea if any of that came into the film, so this feels more made for the artist than the audience. And then the audience wants to feel like an artist and champion it and feel superior. But it's truly a slog, a long death march where I felt like I had to finish it and make it through and when the end credits came up, it really did feel like 572 days long.I mean, if this was made with a camcorder and a $300 budget in 1984 and released on Tempe Video, I'd probably feel dfferently about it. I'd also defend this if it were directed by Bruno Mattei and stole most of its soundtrack from Phantasm.I feel like this was my Jacob's Ladder and I'm still stuck watching it.What do I know?Whenever I eat haute cuisine, I'm always starving afterward and have to stop at a gas station and get several hot dogs off the roller.You can learn more on the official site for the movie.",first featur film director writer kyle edward ball also made proof concept movi name heck video craig moreau aint nuthin skinamarink find origin bites nightmar youtub channel start ball visual nightmar contribut comment shot edmonton alberta home ball grew buzz major debut fine definit feel weird within dark long hallway terrifi child goe arti shot lego block upsid room peopl face play cartoon soundtrack hiss static narr idea keep get push two children wake middl night find father miss window door home vanish would easi find unless knew go kind film would wow film school professor ten minut minut kind movi one frighten thing look see much time left throughout film feel like time keep get ad must push like kind marathon runner endur endless repetit layer imag nois fill audio movi fill jump cut peopl jump cut proclaim cinema movi peopl feel good like ahead peopl get see go world fair movi peopl tweet chang shake dark word like fever dream slow burn take chanc film twitter word realli sound furi signifi noth imagin put whole bunch quiet scene togeth turn light get loud cours everyon scream much like worst elev horror goe back bad parent mean lego go clean somewher dreamland cartoon past hit nail head realli dislik fake grain pop ad like someth fake grindhous trend year ago real terror within movi like host stop replic inferior zoom horror movi sent mani movi next year stare old toy hour someon play xylophon background make coffe shot old pxl camera casio soundtrack get readi mani press releas start influenc skinamarink think ball someth movi set interest thing never deliv wait next scare almost like deconstruct horror film simpl scare yet use repeatedli said movi shoot movi hous grew two charact less sister tri make person sort happen ad benefit mom save bunch childhood toy use movi got even person like see movi idea came film feel made artist audienc audienc want feel like artist champion feel superior truli slog long death march felt like finish make end credit came realli feel like day long mean made camcord budget releas temp video probabl feel dfferent also defend direct bruno mattei stole soundtrack phantasm feel like jacob ladder still stuck watch know whenev eat haut cuisin alway starv afterward stop ga station get sever hot dog roller learn offici site movi

It's also very efficient creating suspense and tension.

Angry that the filmmaker had been so self-indulgent as to presume the audience would be able to withstand 100 minutes of this punishment.I admire what he did, the execution is excellent and I was immediately drawn into the atmosphere that the film exudes. However, as other reviewers have noted, this would have made a decent short film, maybe 20 minutes. As it stands, it overplays it's hand dramatically and had me begging to be relinquished from the monotony of the long takes which comprise the film's bloated runtime.My hope is that Shudder cuts it down significantly before it has an official on-line release.

Skinamarink is a bland, pretentious, a film experimental only on the patience of the people who are watching it. It's all mood, no substance. It's proof you can make a film without a tripod or a light or an actual idea. I nearly fell asleep. I tried to leave early after 35 minutes of nothing happening, but ended up finishing it because the waiter didn't bring me my check until it was almost over anyhow. No, it's not just ""not for me""... it's an awfully done film who can only find an audience in people who like liking things that are anti-mainstream. It tries so little to be anything how can you love or hate it? I don't hate it... you didn't love it. I just nothing'd it. The audience I saw it with had 3 people walk out, other people saying ""I guess the face at the end was scary"". No, people, you aren't wrong... it was utter garbage with a good trailer.

The rest is up to the four year old kid in you.Something about this film invoked a sense of dread in me that I haven't felt in 40 years. It wasn't the thing lurking in the dark that spoke to the children, though. It was the dark itself. It was the unlit corners. It was the absence of the comfort of a parent. It was the strange glow of the TV in a dark room when your unsure of your surroundings. It was that door you left open just a crack.I'm not sure what to think of this film, honestly.

367,Skinamarink,Worst Film of the Year.,1,"Now, I know that this movie technically released in 2022, but didn't come to theaters until 2023. In the second week of January, Skinamarink hits theaters, and is the worst movie of 2023.It played on Friday the 13th, no less. In the same theater I saw this, Friday the 13th part 6 was playing 2 hours later. Figuring that F13 was a later movie, and I'd seen it numerous times, why not check out a new movie?I figured wrong.This is definitely the worst movie I've sat through in my entire life...and that's even after sitting through Pet Sematary 2019, and Halloween Ends.This movie was filmed like a child was trying out his dad's camcorder and didn't properly know how to use it. As if he held the camera in one place, and moved his head instead of the camera, thinking he was recording what his own eyes see.There was no storyline. There was no acting. There were barely any faces. There were about 5 unnecessary jump scares, as in, nothing at all was happening when there was just a jump scare for the sake of calling it a horror movie.I don't think I ever walked out at the end of a movie where the audience was in complete silence trying to have this abomination that passes as cinema sink in. I also don't think I finished a movie and had been as angry as I was to have wasted my time actually going to a theater in hopes of actually seeing a scary movie.Just watch the trailer over and over and it will basically have the same effect as the actual movie.

368,Skinamarink,A chilling finale did not make up for the boring events leading up to it,4,"All the people saying this film is plotless are wrong. There is a plot here, although it is extemely vague and thin. Might be one of the thinnest plotlines I've ever seen and that is what caused the film to be at times unbearably boring for me. I actually enjoyed the aesthetic for the film, the faceless characters, the low light, lofi camera work. It's a style that could present a high creep factor with the proper story to go along with it. This is not that story.I will say this is much better than the director's previous effort 'Heck', which is basically the short film that started this one. It feels like the director has a better grip on the style he's presenting here. That still doesn't make up for the lack of story here.The film opens with one of the children falling down the stairs and this starts the chain of events that make me believe the child actually died when this happened and he is living in some purgatory or hell. What follows after this could only be described as mean spirited and harsh, but it unfolds so slowly that you feel like you're just watching paint dry. There are some suitably creepy moments but they are few and far between. Actually there is maybe about 3 or 4 creepy scenes in the entire film, the ending being far and wide the most uncomfortable. Had me looking over my shoulder as I was leaving the theater.(I had the whole theater to myself, I'm assuming due to bad weather, but it was probably the best way to watch this film as isolation is a major theme.) The ending felt like I was being personally talked to by the faceless, out of focus boy and I hated it, but in a good way.All in all, I still couldn't call this a good movie and it will only appeal to a very niche horror crowd. I commend the director for creating something so different.

370,Skinamarink,Too minimalist but what do you expect for 15k,5,"I did not dislike this movie. It was more or less exactly what I expected. As a fan of the creepy aesthetic of David Lynch and movies that challenge the audience I wasn't too disappointed. I love the concept and appreciate the approach but ultimately if you are going to ask an audience for 90-120 minutes of their time I think a film should give them more than Skinamarink delivers. Still, from a first time filmmaker it's an admirable effort.I far prefer slow burning horror films that play to the fear of the unknown and an have an underlying sense of dread (The Witch, Hereditary, and The Blair Witch Project are personal faves). Skinamarink tries to play in this arena but doesn't effectively use any cinematic tools to build tension or make the viewer anxious. No soundtrack, very little camera movement, and not enough dynamic use of light and shadow. All things that I think probably could have been achieved, even with a miniscule budget. Thematically it starts in a very minable vein but then doesn't actually develop what amounts to a fairly universal experience of fear (i.e. Being a defenseless child abandoned by caregivers). We feel isolated and alone with the children but are distanced from the sense that anything frightening is happening I think because so little of the film takes place from the children's perspective. It did get me thinking about how to make a horror movie driven by fear of the unknown. If you want to make something universally scary how much do you need to show the audience to prime them to be afraid and how much can you leave to their imaginations? In the end Skinamarink asks the individual viewer to fill in too many blanks for it to be an effective horror movie in my opinion. Truly neurotic people will probably find it unnerving and anxiety inducing but aside from a couple of cheap jump scares nothing particularly interesting happens. My impression was that the vast majority of people will most likely find the movie a waste of time and for that reason I cannot recommend it. But if you like a challenge, are home alone on a stormy night, and/or are capable of letting your imagination run wild then, sure, give it a shot.",dislik movi less exactli expect fan creepi aesthet david lynch movi challeng audienc disappoint love concept appreci approach ultim go ask audienc minut time think film give skinamarink deliv still first time filmmak admir effort far prefer slow burn horror film play fear unknown underli sens dread witch hereditari blair witch project person fave skinamarink tri play arena effect use cinemat tool build tension make viewer anxiou soundtrack littl camera movement enough dynam use light shadow thing think probabl could achiev even miniscul budget themat start minabl vein actual develop amount fairli univers experi fear e defenseless child abandon caregiv feel isol alon children distanc sens anyth frighten happen think littl film take place children perspect get think make horror movi driven fear unknown want make someth univers scari much need show audienc prime afraid much leav imagin end skinamarink ask individu viewer fill mani blank effect horror movi opinion truli neurot peopl probabl find unnerv anxieti induc asid coupl cheap jump scare noth particularli interest happen impress vast major peopl like find movi wast time reason cannot recommend like challeng home alon stormi night capabl let imagin run wild sure give shot

373,Skinamarink,"I get why some find it boring,",9,"But I did not.Yes, Kyle Edward Ball's audaciously odd directorial debut is about 25-30 minutes too long, edited in such a way that too many shots overstay their welcome.Yes, it is filmed in a manner to seemingly intentionally test an audience's patience with still shots that hide the characters' faces and set aside narrative momentum in favor of metaphorical experimentation.This will bother, and clearly has bothered, a lot of people. And I get it. It's not what they wanted. No hard feelings to these people. But now I want to talk about why I loved this film.I was absolutely gripped by Skinamarink. I found so much depth and meaning to come from its bare-bones visual and aural presentation.It's so, so ambiguous. But that didn't bother me because rather than showing bizarre imagery for the sake of it like so many experimental films, Ball instead keeps a GREAT deal of unknown in each frame.The creaky, eerie sound complimented the ever-shifting static of the cinematography to make my brain play all kinds of tricks on me. A handful of horrifying disturbing images make an appearance throughout the film, but the constant wondering of ""what was that sound"" or ""did I see something move in the frame"" made me just as on edge throughout.Though short on plot, I still found surprising thematic/character depth in each of the movie's unsettling, eerie frames of a single house.We don't get to know much about Kevin and Kaylee, but we know what kind of relationship they have as young siblings from the film's opening scenes, and it is so soul-crushing to see what happens and doesn't happen to them over the story's nightmarish happenings.As these kids are stalked in their house by something unknown and unseen, the horrifying things we see and hear are so clearly indicative of common childhood fears, traumas, and challenges: divorce, nightmares, abandonment, neglect, death, and a lack of control over your own choices.Seeing them play out on screen in such an uncanny way was so sad and so terrifying. The film's lack of a musical score, lack of concrete answers, piercing sound design, and ability to turn the intimacies of childhood into faceless, unknowable antagonists all made this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.",ye kyle edward ball audaci odd directori debut minut long edit way mani shot overstay welcom ye film manner seemingli intent test audienc patienc still shot hide charact face set asid narr momentum favor metaphor experiment bother clearli bother lot peopl get want hard feel peopl want talk love film absolut grip skinamarink found much depth mean come bare bone visual aural present ambigu bother rather show bizarr imageri sake like mani experiment film ball instead keep great deal unknown frame creaki eeri sound compliment ever shift static cinematographi make brain play kind trick hand horrifi disturb imag make appear throughout film constant wonder sound see someth move frame made edg throughout though short plot still found surpris themat charact depth movi unsettl eeri frame singl hous get know much kevin kayle know kind relationship young sibl film open scene soul crush see happen happen stori nightmarish happen kid stalk hous someth unknown unseen horrifi thing see hear clearli indic common childhood fear trauma challeng divorc nightmar abandon neglect death lack control choic see play screen uncanni way sad terrifi film lack music score lack concret answer pierc sound design abil turn intimaci childhood faceless unknow antagonist made one scariest movi ever seen
374,Skinamarink,The Rebirth of Primal Childhood Fears - A Reward for the Patient,7,"""Skinamarink"" is undoubtedly one of the most unique viewing experiences in my existing memory, and it's rather challenging for me to truly pinpoint my own reaction and opinion of it. Depending on your taste, it can be equal parts a liminal horror masterpiece and a true tedium. I know one thing to be true, it requires absolute attention and maximum immersion to get out of it all that director Kyle Edward Ball intended to do to you.Two little children, 5 year old Kaylee and her 4 years old brother Kevin, wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. Definitely sounds like a concept to bring a lot of creeps. And so it does. ""Skinamarink"" starts out with the slowest pacing I've ever experienced, and during the first 20-30 minutes one might feel the temptation to give up on this film. The entire cinematography, the sum of the 100 minute runtime consists almost exclusively of obscure shots of just about everything in the (director's childhood) house, except people. You practically don't see character's faces at all, only legs. Ceiling. Walls. Furniture. Darkness, a lot of darkness, holding within itself the dreadful sense than anything can come into your eyes and mind at any given time. The screen is full of grain and 70's-like screen scratches, the depthless dark keeps morphing, and the sense of dread is creeping-crawling around every corner of every frame. You know that weird, scary pile of clothes in your room in the middle of the night? This is that: the movie. It's an absolute trump move to put such youngins as main characters, the rebirth of your most primal childhood fears is what Kyle Edward Ball wants to offer you. Most people seek the kind of comfort an ignorant bliss they had as young children, but director of ""Skinamarink"" serves just the opposite of that spectrum.It's a liminal, esoteric, ambient, analogue, lo-fi horror if I've ever seen one. And made with palpable, impressive confidence. Slowly, very slowly, but surely, ""Skinamarink"" lulls one into the deep sense of unease, hiding short, momentary glimpses of absolute terror inbetween long periods of almost sheer ambient nothingness. It's a movie that rewards the patient. Ball gives us a playground in which our imagination will do more work than the movie itself, and that's not a negative critique, but quite the feat.""Skinamarink"" creates a tiny yet massive world, from which there is no escape. Days after seeing it, I'm still trying to grasp what I saw, and on what scale I enjoyed it. This film has gotten the kind of buzz no art can buy, and rightly so, I believe it will be remembered as cult film, perhaps even as a revolutionary kind of horror.

375,Skinamarink,"I wanted to like it, I really did.",6,"I'm pretty sure I understand what the director is trying to do, and believe it or not, I respect him for it. A lot of the time, I was, indeed, thinking of my childhood nightmares and irrational fears, like many others have said they did. But it didn't scare me. Despite all the hype on Reddit and going in without expectations, it just didn't do much of anything for me.I think it's partly because I KNOW those fears are irrational and I just can't put myself in the mindset of my inner child anymore, not to mention I'm well-attuned to the dark side of things, so it doesn't feel as threatening now. Another reason is because the ""scary"" moments in the movie are relegated to a few small jumpscares, and some moments where you THINK something bad is about to happen, but without the payoff. Lastly, I don't think the ultra-minimalistic approach is for me. While the unknown can definitely be scary when done right, I require identifiable traits to characters beyond just voices and footsteps to feel anything for them.There's definitely parts that made me slightly unnerved, such as the disembodied voice - an entity or possibly the darkness itself - instructing one of the children to put a knife in their eye, with the sound of a child crying shortly afterwards. Unfortunately, the movie's too long for its own good. I watched it pretty late at night when I was tired and winding down, so that might have had something to do with me being less than impressed.Like I said, I respect the director's effort. He's clearly trying to make minimalism scary, and assuming that he's not astroturfing it (I will say I'm a little suspicious that the movie started out with something over 4 stars only to get a 5.5 in like a week after I last checked), he seems to have succeeded with at least a few, and I genuinely admire that. I just don't think his style is for me. I checked out some of his short films, including Heck, which is sort of a prototype for Skinamarink, but didn't feel any actual dread. I still feel bad about checking it out early instead of waiting for a mass release in the US, so I'm willing to give it another try so that Kyle at least gets his money's worth from me watching it.",pretti sure understand director tri believ respect lot time inde think childhood nightmar irrat fear like mani other said scare despit hype reddit go without expect much anyth think partli know fear irrat put mindset inner child anymor mention well attun dark side thing feel threaten anoth reason scari moment movi releg small jumpscar moment think someth bad happen without payoff lastli think ultra minimalist approach unknown definit scari done right requir identifi trait charact beyond voic footstep feel anyth definit part made slightli unnerv disembodi voic entiti possibl dark instruct one children put knife eye sound child cri shortli afterward unfortun movi long good watch pretti late night tire wind might someth less impress like said respect director effort clearli tri make minim scari assum astroturf say littl suspici movi start someth star get like week last check seem succeed least genuin admir think style check short film includ heck sort prototyp skinamarink feel actual dread still feel bad check earli instead wait mass releas us will give anoth tri kyle least get money worth watch

A book that has a similar theme of a house that has rooms that constantly change, people disappear etc. And as someone that has grown up watching experimental films, as well as listening to and making experimental music, I thought the pace of the film was just right.The power of suggestion is always a good thing, and the fact that there was little footage of actual people present here works well. It added to the sense of isolation in the house. The whispering too was a nice touch. The children sensed there was something there.I also found the atmosphere throughout kind of relaxing.

Only reason I gave this more than one star was because there is a very effective scene involving one of the children in his parents' room, but that's about it.

380,Skinamarink,"Believe me, the emperor has no clothes here...",1,"I lasted a little less than an hour before I couldn't take any more of this complete travesty of a cow pie and turned it off. There are ads currently hyping this film to prepare it for a theatrical release (and if this can find a distributor, anything can), and once audiences realize they've been totally had, it will die the quiet death it deserves. Basically the ""plot"" consists of watching two kids monotonously crawl around an empty house in the dark, with the same group of point-of-view shots endlessly repeated over and over again. There is nothing ""creepy"" or ""horrifying"" about it whatsoever... it's just appallingly empty and pretentious. The film has a running time of 100 minutes, but it appears the filmmaker shot only about 15 or 20 of actual footage and just repeated most of the same shots over and over again during the editing process, ad nauseum. I'm a huge fan of independent and experimental horror films, but this load of excrement doesn't even come close to even fitting that genre, it just insults the intelligence. The reviews here claiming it's frightening have got to be either planted, or if they're not, written by people who must have a scare quotient of -10. The film has been making the rounds on the internet for some time now, and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it - it's seriously not worth the admission price of a dollar.

381,Magic Mke,It's not about the stripping...,8,"This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, but—as Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, ""That's what I do—it's not who I am."" Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term ""self-actualization"" in a review of ""Magic Mike""; I told you you might be shocked.At any rate, plenty of folks (like the pathetic woman who was sitting behind me in the theater, the one who clapped like a poorly trained seal, guffawed, and cackled any time the least bit of male skin appeared on screen) will go see this movie because of all the hype about the hot male bodies in various states of undress—and they will certainly enjoy the film on that very basic level. But let's be honest here, folks—this is a Stephen Soderbergh film—and Soderbergh does not use sex and titillation gratuitously. The plot is compelling, the film is well written and masterfully directed, and Channing Tatum proves that he is much, much more than a hot body and a pretty face. For his sake, here's hoping that ""Magic Mike"" can propel him along a career path similar to those of other handsome actors who managed to overcome ""Movie Star"" looks to prove that they were genuine actors.

382,Magic Mke,Aside from the stripping there's nothing new here but I was never bored,7,"This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.First let's get the nude issue out of the way. There is only one full frontal in the movie--it's off to the side, is partially blocked and is probably faked. It's also very funny. There's mostly butt shots only but all are from Tatum, Pettyfer and Adam Rodriguez. This movie is NOT about the nudity. The movie moves slow (although I was never bored) and main events happen off screen OR are never explained! Still the movie works. For one thing all the acting is good. I was surprised at how good Tatum was. I never thought he could act till this. He captures his character perfectly. Pettyfer was equally good as Adam. Even Matthew McConaughey was good as the group's owner named Dallas. The strip acts themselves are incredible. All the guys are in good shape and Tatum shows some moves that are jaw-dropping! However they're not shot in an exploitive fashion. They're done in a matter of fact way that actually makes them seem quite funny. This movie (script wise) shows us nothing new but it was well-made and entertaining. This is not just for women and gay men--I think everyone would enjoy it.

383,Magic Mke,"The law says you cannot touch, but I think I see a lotta lawbreakers up in this house tonight...",9,"Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a ""male stripper movie,"" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a ""gay cowboy movie."" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, ""Worst movie ever."" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, ""Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?"" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.The cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never really liked in the films he starred in before, but he is just phenomenal in this film. Horn, on the other hand, seemed to come out from nowhere, but her rapport with Tatum is terrific. Let's also not forget about Matthew McConaughey. Even though he isn't in the film that much, he steals every single scene he's in. He's just that good.MAGIC MIKE will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to ""a movie for the ladies."" MAGIC MIKE is funny and dramatic when it needs to be, but the main reason it succeeds is because of the cast. Overall, MAGIC MIKE is a very good film. Just don't expect a lot of stripping.",mani peopl like gener thing make easier understand world trailer magic mike reveal label male stripper movi like brokeback mountain gay cowboy movi gener label undermin downgrad film actual qualiti even overshadow fact steven soderbergh director rare make film lack substanc ye magic mike style substanc well kicker want see film primarili strip may left disappoint like fidget seat scene come one ladi sit next said credit roll worst movi ever hand refus see film subject matter may miss great film state simpli magic mike boogi night lite bad thing consid utterli dark depress boogi night get second half first half magic mike light breezi quit funni fact joke funnier modern comedi tri achiev introduc world fascin surprisingli mundan econom center strip sequenc fill energi sexi mostli play laugh get expos lot male ass rip ab pelvic thrust good fun thing slowli start take dark turn second half hard imagin peopl think wait strip movi charact start make bad decis one thing lead anoth get idea cast terrif around chan tatum good lead role play comedi drama effect howev want give huge shout alex pettyfr codi horn pull terrif perform substanti role pettyfr particular never realli like film star phenomen film horn hand seem come nowher rapport tatum terrif let also forget matthew mcconaughey even though film much steal everi singl scene good magic mike either surpris disappoint depend expect still film gender enjoy limit movi ladi magic mike funni dramat need main reason succe cast overal magic mike good film expect lot strip

385,Magic Mke,"Very Slow Comedy, but brings in Great Laughs and Performances,",7,"Magic Mike is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's an enjoyable movie that brings in many laughs, as well as terrific performances from the entire cast, the chemistry between everyone is great, particularly the parts between Channing Tatum and Cody Horn, they both seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company and their scenes were very natural. It's a really slow movie and can admittedly get very boring at times, there are a lot of very lengthy scenes were the characters are literally just talking, while they are well acted and serve as a great method for character development, they can still get very tedious, they could have easily trimmed a lot of scenes and made it a more bearable ninety minute run. The highlight of the movie is definitely Matthew McConaughey, playing a character unlike one he has ever played before, he is very natural and charismatic in the role of Dallas, his scenes certainly had me entertained the most. It may be very slow, but Magic Milke is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, easy to watch, comedy if you ever see it on television and had some time to kill.

386,Magic Mke,"Trailer is misleading, great movie though",8,"The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.Soderbergh crafts a powerful but almost self-defeating film that I doubt will be a huge popularity winner due to its unconventional story. (Sidenote: why is it that filmmakers can make critically-acclaimed masterpieces about female strippers/prostitutes, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if the g-string is on the other gender it's just goofy fun?) Due to its deceptive marketing, ""Magic Mike"" is passed off as crowd-pleasing entertainment, but it's really a very sobering look at life with more introspective moments than laughs.Channing Tatum plays Mike, a guy with the bod of a Greek god, probably not very educated but with a very smart, creative ambition: to build artistic furniture. Somehow, instead, he ends up thrusting his pelvis on stage for screaming ladies. Enter Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year-old kid who, like many 19-year-olds, doesn't have a clue. Mike takes Adam under his wing and introduces him to the night life, all the while promising Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that he'll take care of Adam.If you can see where this is going, then great. That's the point. ""Magic Mike"" does something that few films have the guts to do. It sets up a predictable situation and then takes us through exactly that. No wacky, contrived plot twists necessary. Instead it focuses on how different people react and change when confronted with a predictable set of events.Another thing this film does, better than any other I've seen in recent memory, is that it gives us REAL dialogue. I'm talking about the scenes between Mike & Brooke. It's every bit as real as something you'd experience in real life, right down to the stammering, the awkward fidgeting, the ""flubbed lines"". I put that in quotations because I'm not sure if the script was written that way, or if Tatum actually flubbed a few lines and Soderbergh left them in. My point is that the dialogue & chemistry between those two is so believable you'd think they didn't have a camera on them.""Magic Mike"" is not for everyone. It can't be accurately summed up with some exuberant catchphrase like ""Laugh out loud funny!"" or ""A tragic masterpiece!"" or ""Nail biting suspense!"" Also I would say that this is a very uncomfortable date movie, a very uncomfortable bro movie, and it's probably too heavy for a fun, gal's night out movie. If you do see it, it's probably best watched alone so you can really soak in the personal story it's telling. On an individual level I think we can all relate to the idea of being sidetracked by the pursuit of a dream, rather than the dream itself, regardless of if we're guys wearing buttless cowboy pants in front of 200 squealing, undersexed women.",upbeat trailer quippi banter cute gag promis washboard ab tight tushi mislead imdb plot summari make want hurl male stripper teach younger perform parti pick women make easi money magic mike great movi differ reason differ audienc trailer may attract fun wild romp quirki romcom lot chuckl complex drama focus success vs illus success could set wall street could set law firm could set one paragon success envis hear word instead set male nudi bar ton hormon rage women wave hurl stuf bill men thong underwear soderbergh craft power almost self defeat film doubt huge popular winner due unconvent stori sidenot filmmak make critic acclaim masterpiec femal stripper prostitut like leav la vega g string gender goofi fun due decept market magic mike pass crowd pleas entertain realli sober look life introspect moment laugh chan tatum play mike guy bod greek god probabl educ smart creativ ambit build artist furnitur somehow instead end thrust pelvi stage scream ladi enter adam alex pettyf year old kid like mani year old clue mike take adam wing introduc night life promis adam sister brook codi horn take care adam see go great point magic mike someth film gut set predict situat take us exactli wacki contriv plot twist necessari instead focus differ peopl react chang confront predict set event anoth thing film better seen recent memori give us real dialogu talk scene mike brook everi bit real someth experi real life right stammer awkward fidget flub line put quotat sure script written way tatum actual flub line soderbergh left point dialogu chemistri two believ think camera magic mike everyon accur sum exuber catchphras like laugh loud funni tragic masterpiec nail bite suspens also would say uncomfort date movi uncomfort bro movi probabl heavi fun gal night movi see probabl best watch alon realli soak person stori tell individu level think relat idea sidetrack pursuit dream rather dream regardless guy wear buttless cowboy pant front squeal undersex women

The only scenes that are the slightest bit interesting are on stage in the club. The rest of the time it's actors spouting bad dialogue with little or nothing to do. Classic lines like ""Hey"" and ""Hey do you want to get something to eat?"". They walk and talk. They sit and talk. They drink and talk. They stare toward the right or left or look at the ocean like it's supposed to mean something.Some of the original music is interesting and fits. The film has a golden tone appearance to the scenes outside of the club which becomes distracting and adds nothing. There's a scene after the sorority fight scene that seems out of place before the confrontation in the club.

388,Magic Mke,"Schizophrenic: Why ""Magic Mike"" doesn't work",4,"As I watched ""Magic Mike"", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.And then it ended.I was confused. So many things didn't make sense. So many questions were left unanswered. Where was the conflict's resolution? What happened to Adam? When did Mike and Brooke fall in love? What was with Tarzan's character? Did I have the wrong mindset? The problem with ""Magic Mike"" is that it attempts to appeal to every form of movie watcher and, instead, appeals only to the ladies fanning themselves while mesmerized by abs and biceps. While Mike (a surprisingly decent Channing Tatum) is an interesting character, the movie's structure and story suffer from Steven Soderbergh's direction.1. ""Magic Mike"" has no goal. No themes, no morals, no bottom-line. We see hints of anti-drug sentimentality, and Soderbergh draws a little attention to the effects of the male stripper world on the male mind. But these elements are only hints, and are abandoned by the time the credits roll. Mike doesn't regret his actions as a stripper, only that he continued to be one into his 30's. He dabbles in drugs in one (hyper-extended and annoying) montage-esque scene, but that event too has few direct consequences.All this would be okay if the movie was a comedy. However...2. ""Magic Mike"" isn't funny. Not by any stretch of the imagination. We have some witty remarks that are bound to induce some smiles, but the only laughs come from people's ""shock"" from the dance numbers. There are no jokes, no slapstick humor, and the dance numbers really aren't that amusing (to a male). The only truly funny scene is when Adam (a bored looking Alex Pettyfer) is first backstage with Tarzan and the other strippers.If this movie lacks a drama's thematic elements and a comedy's laughs, then it must be a romance, right?3. ""Magic Mike"" isn't romantic. In fact, Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) don't let any sparks fly at all. A relationship between the two isn't even a possibility until they get into their first shouting match, near (what I assume to be) the movie's climax. Their relationship is never given time to grow because the movie's first half tries to build a story around Adam and Mike's relationship. However, the second half drops Adam almost completely and attempts to bring in Brooke. Both relationships fall flat, not to mention Adam ends up as a terrible human being.In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies because Soderbergh shoots high and misses everything. Also, ""Magic Mike"" is peppered with extended ""erotic"" dance numbers that add nothing to the plot and exist purely to satisfy the target audience: middle-aged women. These scenes, in addition to the movie's schizophrenic lack of direction, will disappoint any movie lover's hopes of seeing a film that provides insight into the mind of a male stripper.At least, the audience could have used a decent ending.",watch magic mike entertain hope element fascin storylin seem head interest direct new scene seem lead toward climax could make movi run time worthwhil end confus mani thing make sens mani question left unansw conflict resolut happen adam mike brook fall love tarzan charact wrong mindset problem magic mike attempt appeal everi form movi watcher instead appeal ladi fan mesmer ab bicep mike surprisingli decent chan tatum interest charact movi structur stori suffer steven soderbergh direct magic mike goal theme moral bottom line see hint anti drug sentiment soderbergh draw littl attent effect male stripper world male mind element hint abandon time credit roll mike regret action stripper continu one dabbl drug one hyper extend annoy montag esqu scene event direct consequ would okay movi comedi howev magic mike funni stretch imagin witti remark bound induc smile laugh come peopl shock danc number joke slapstick humor danc number realli amus male truli funni scene adam bore look alex pettyf first backstag tarzan stripper movi lack drama themat element comedi laugh must romanc right magic mike romant fact mike brook codi horn let spark fli relationship two even possibl get first shout match near assum movi climax relationship never given time grow movi first half tri build stori around adam mike relationship howev second half drop adam almost complet attempt bring brook relationship fall flat mention adam end terribl human end audienc get casserol movi element littl satisfact come watch type movi soderbergh shoot high miss everyth also magic mike pepper extend erot danc number add noth plot exist pure satisfi target audienc middl age women scene addit movi schizophren lack direct disappoint movi lover hope see film provid insight mind male stripper least audienc could use decent end
389,Magic Mke,Way more magic involved than I had presumed,9,"It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same ""the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie"". I couldn't disagree more.I went into the movie with basically no expectations. In my opinion, Soderbergh is completely hit or miss. He has classics like Sex, Lies, and Videotape and stinkers like The Girlfriend Experience. This is the only movie of his aside from Sex, Lies, and Videotape that I have truly loved through and through.I don't know what people are talking about criticizing the acting. This is one of the best roles I have seen Tatum pull. Matthew McConaughy is perfect as the head slime ball. The lead who plays ""The Kid"" or Adam is a completely believable representation of every guy who is in his shoes in the world. And the sister Brooke, while coming off as a little obnoxious with her grim stares around the beginning of the movie, had a tough role to play but she did it with flying colors as well - by the end of the film she becomes a quite endearing figure.The soundtrack was good. The camera work and editing was innovative. There were some really cool montage-esque segments towards the middle of the movie that actually worked really well and were pretty stylish. The cinematography during the dance sequences are especially vibing and impressive as well.People complain there is no plot or ending - I think these people must be lacking depth or lacking a brain in general. From the very start, the movie flowed very well, a slow and smooth grind into the world that we will end up spending the rest of it's length existing in. The movie maintains an impressive realism through the majority of it's scenes - instead of trying to feel like a blockbuster feature, it feels like what it would feel like in reality. The focus of the plot changes slightly throughout the film, but stays open and interesting. And the ending, I don't think could have been more perfect - if you take nothing from it, well, you must be missing a lot of things in life.I dunno what else to say! This is absolutely one of my favorite Soderbergh movies and easily one of the best movies I have seen this year in 2012 so far.

391,Magic Mke,Not the way real dancers are.,4,"I was a stripper. Yes, I was. I was fairly good too.This film however doesn't capture the reality behind the stage, on-stage or even the crowd.The reality is that the male dancers - or even female dancers aren't all friends...they are greedy, selfish ego tripping characters who look forward only to the dollars. They fight backstage, they get drunk back stage and they do serious amounts of coke back stage.Most male dancers are also gay. I am not and for that reason, the few men that are not gay will be reading ""picture books"" behind the curtain to ensure that they are ""up"" to the challenge when they are on stage.The gay men will be taking care of each other respectively before they go on stage.Most female crowds are mostly fat, overweight women who are nearing 50 and are there to get totally drunk. Male dancers will go to the table for them and pull everything off, but will not take them on-stage and perform nasty acts - clothed or unclothed.Also - we didn't have groups of 5 or 6 go up on-stage and perform a routine set. With people travelling all the time and new people coming in and out, we barely knew who each other was from a daily basis.Nobody fraternized with the bar-staff after closing...everybody was tired, stressed or too stoned to do anything. The bar-staff closed up and everybody got kicked out.If anybody tried to do a back-flip on-stage, they would have been fired or told not to do that again...because of liability and safety and insurance reasons.We made our money doing lap dances...not having a hundred girls throw money in our underwear on-stage.The back room dressing areas were always slightly better than a warehouse - filled with all sorts of bar crap...regardless of the bar or location.Anybody under the legal limit would never be allowed on-stage. There was always vice to make sure.There was always so much tension in the dressing room...because we were competing for the same money, that more than the mere basic communication between dancers never existed.This is a film based on the male stripper occupation, but misses out on the reality of it.It's also over drawn for plot. So much could be edited out and would not make a difference to the story.I was looking forward to see this, and I finally did.

As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next...

You get old mighty quick in the game as Channing Tatum in the title role realizes. He's got a day job and he's saving his money to start a business.On that day job is Alex Pettyfer who hasn't got it as together as Tatum does. So when Tatum brings him into the male strip club to work for McConaughey, young Pettyfer becomes an instant star. His sister Cody Horn is concerned for him because he's also a bit of screw-up. She hopes that Tatum will keep him somewhat in line. She kind of likes Tatum herself.A person I know who is in this line tells me Magic Mike was better than he thought it would be. Both of us were prepared for something truly trashy and Magic Mike wasn't that at all. The characters were both real and engaging though if you want to see some erotic male dancing than this is a movie that will provide.I'd check this out, but don't bring the kiddies.",unless go go busi end like matthew mcconaughey male strip definit enter legal major bit beyond get old mighti quick game chan tatum titl role realiz got day job save money start busi day job alex pettyf got togeth tatum tatum bring male strip club work mcconaughey young pettyf becom instant star sister codi horn concern also bit screw hope tatum keep somewhat line kind like tatum person know line tell magic mike better thought would us prepar someth truli trashi magic mike charact real engag though want see erot male danc movi provid check bring kiddi
395,Magic Mke,The lifestyle of male strippers with characters and dichotomies,7,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims ""I was hoping it was all a joke."" I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, ""No, but it is pretty funny."" He's also right.""Magic Mike"" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.Shortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.Also as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the ""proper"" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.I am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.",mike chan tatum stripper also contractor furnitur busi entrepreneur actual pretti stand young man adam alex pettyf put togeth sister want ventur xquisit male danc revu exclaim hope joke blame thought mike respond pretti funni also right magic mike inde male strip club stripper routin funni definit went far time think part joke matthew mcconaughey club owner seem play charact play sort tongu cheek joke make fun type role get fearless will say anyth get joke someth special actor like shortli releas posit critic review start come plu realiz direct steven soderbergh make one think perhap movi guy strip well ye major movi lifestyl accompani male stripper plenti scene predominantli femal audienc ogl danc move expect get annoy quickli also expect lifestyl accompani male stripper involv easi women drug bought lot money mike tri stay style live know want life proper way get hand adam much want hard live style exactli want life lead brilliant sequenc near end film mike old enough pass quarter life crisi adam approach one cross road also assum soderbergh chosen direct someth differ choos interest light effect strang camera angl fun suppos genr known invent think much effort necessari charact particularli dichotomi ad make film worth
396,Magic Mke,Magic Mike: Needed More Magic and Less Mike,3,"Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants ""something more"" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.I won't spoiler the actual film but here's what its about: Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a construction worker by day and male stripper by night. He meets pretty boy Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn) at work and gets Adam a stripping job at the strip joint owned by Dallas (""I see a lot of law breakers""...must a say HIS name?). Romantic fireworks explode between characters and Adam gets into trouble along the way.Here's how I'm going to analyze: Story: All I can about the story is that it is your typical romantic 21st century Hollywood film. You can predict the whole movie and ending very easily.Characters: These characters were walking cardboards. Mike, Adam, Brooke, Joanna, Norah, even Tarzan, etc HAD NO PERSONALITY! The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies). I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times.Acting: I hated to judge this part because there isn't much to judge. The acting is...mediocre at best. Channing Tatum plays the role he plays in every film of his: the good guy with little personality. I feel Tatum CAN really act but he needs to expand his range like Johnny Depp does or Heath Ledger use to. Adam Pettyfer has tried to expand his range (like in ""Beastly"")but the kid, as good looking as he is, just can't act. Cody Horn was the weakest link. She'll probably be the next Julia Stiles, meaning she'll be cast in the same role in every film (good films probably) next to good looking guys even though she can't act.These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. The only song in the film I could remember was ""Its Raining Men"". The directing had some shaky camera. I remember that. The visuals were...okay. If you like naked men.Overall, the film was...""eh"". I was bored through most of it and I left the theater with no intentions to ever see it again. I gave the film three stars out of ten. The film needed more ""magic"" in storytelling and originality then ""Mike"" just being your typical Hollywood dream guy that doesn't really exist.",magic mike one mani film could guess plot exactli saw know super predict seen mani movi anyway predict film would go saw popular guy pretti good life turn disney princess want someth life use meet girl fall love girl torn life girl shockingli pick girl limit person instead pretti good life live happili ever predict saw movi spoiler actual film magic mike chan tatum construct worker day male stripper night meet pretti boy adam alex pettyf live sister brook codi horn work get adam strip job strip joint own dalla see lot law breaker must say name romant firework explod charact adam get troubl along way go analyz stori stori typic romant st centuri hollywood film predict whole movi end easili charact charact walk cardboard mike adam brook joanna norah even tarzan etc person charact somewhat interest dalla strip least sorri ladi could care less happen charact depth feel attach seen clich charact million time act hate judg part much judg act mediocr best chan tatum play role play everi film good guy littl person feel tatum realli act need expand rang like johnni depp heath ledger use adam pettyf tri expand rang like beastli kid good look act codi horn weakest link probabl next julia stile mean cast role everi film good film probabl next good look guy even though act thing critiqu direct music edit etc focus song film could rememb rain men direct shaki camera rememb visual okay like nake men overal film eh bore left theater intent ever see gave film three star ten film need magic storytel origin mike typic hollywood dream guy realli exist
397,Magic Mke,One for the ladies (and gentlemen),6,"The usherette tittered when I bought my ticket. 'Why do you laugh?' I asked. 'Because only girls are watching this'. Clearly this is someone who doesn't believe in the universality of cinema. Yes, Steven Soderbergh's latest features male strippers, and yes it will appeal more to a certain demographic, but so will every film. Audiences may be disparate but films are androgynous. Or should be. As 'Magic' Mike, charming Channing Tatum naturally gets top billing, but the film revolves around Adam (rising star Alex Pettyfer). Adam is a congenital loser, the kind of guy who refuses to wear a tie and wonders why he can't sustain a job. He lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), whose acting conveys a suspicion of men, presumably because she has only her wayward brother as a yardstick. Adam finds work on a construction site with Mike, who sees the desperation of Adam's situation and entices him to join his exotic dancing troupe, Xquisite, led by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Dallas astutely exploits Adam's naivety by branding him 'The Kid', an amateurish, sloppy act, which the ladies love. The next three months are a non-stop orgy of girls, booze and drugs: everything a man like Adam could wish for. This lifestyle has lost its appeal for Mike, now 30, who only took up professional undressing to become a bespoke furniture salesman. He no longer wishes to hold out for the phantom 10% of the business Dallas keeps promising him, but poor credit keeps him on the pole. (Tatum again stars in a role which brings out his effortless charisma and sweetness.)McConaughey recently impressed me in William Friedkin's 'Killer Joe', and now this film has completely changed my mind about him. He's gone from my dud to my stud list in just two films. And Pettyfer works because he doesn't work, if you see what I mean. Although an ex-model, he's not 'stripper material' (not that I'd know much about that sort of thing), yet there's a naturalness to his acting, which works. Although not in the same league as some of Soderbergh's other titles (notably 'Traffic' and 'Out of Sight'), there's enough going on to warrant a viewing. Characters are well written, lives intersect in an unforced manner, motivations are believable. There's plenty of saucy (and quite impressive) dancing to keep the majority of this film's audience happy, but there's also a decent story for those who aren't watching exclusively for nudity. www.moseleyb13.com",usherett titter bought ticket laugh ask girl watch clearli someon believ univers cinema ye steven soderbergh latest featur male stripper ye appeal certain demograph everi film audienc may dispar film androgyn magic mike charm chan tatum natur get top bill film revolv around adam rise star alex pettyf adam congenit loser kind guy refus wear tie wonder sustain job live sister brook codi horn whose act convey suspicion men presum wayward brother yardstick adam find work construct site mike see desper adam situat entic join exot danc troup xquisit led dalla matthew mcconaughey dalla astut exploit adam naiveti brand kid amateurish sloppi act ladi love next three month non stop orgi girl booz drug everyth man like adam could wish lifestyl lost appeal mike took profession undress becom bespok furnitur salesman longer wish hold phantom busi dalla keep promis poor credit keep pole tatum star role bring effortless charisma sweet mcconaughey recent impress william friedkin killer joe film complet chang mind gone dud stud list two film pettyf work work see mean although ex model stripper materi know much sort thing yet natur act work although leagu soderbergh titl notabl traffic sight enough go warrant view charact well written live intersect unforc manner motiv believ plenti sauci quit impress danc keep major film audienc happi also decent stori watch exclus nuditi www moseleyb com
398,Magic Mke,Too much of one's ego and no director on sight to take hold on it:(,4,"Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking ""You can't just get enough of pretty naked men"". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of ""Let's make a good film"" attitude rather than purely ""Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club""...

400,Magic Mke,"More Magic, Mike, More Magic",6,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"" is short on needed magic. The promised backstage tale of male strippers conjures images of sexy men, pulsating music, and erotic choreography. Unfortunately, the expected companion piece to ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" is not even ""The Full Monty."" Magic Mike, competently played by Channing Tatum, is a construction worker by day, a stripper by night, and a furniture designer by ambition. A fellow hard hat on the construction site, Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer, is drawn into Mike's stripper world by the lure of easy money and even easier sex. Little unexpected happens, and the audience for naked male flesh and sexual couplings is better served at the local porn shop.The dialog is lame and often delivered listlessly. Perhaps strippers and their friends are low-key characters and talk like Mike and his friends, but eyes glaze and brains go numb after nearly two hours spent in their company. A physically fit Matthew McConaughey looks almost cadaverous as Dallas, the strippers' tough manager. However, McConaughey is effective, and his scenes resuscitate the film when he is on screen, which is all too briefly. Despite his age, McConaughey has the vulgar moves, the erotic gyrations, and the sexual aura that the other supposed strippers lack.""Magic Mike"" drags on and seems longer than it is. Soderbergh inserts a few arty shots, but generally fails to even capture the excitement of a ""Flashdance,"" a glossy construction-worker-cum-dancer feature-length music video that moved to a beat and never bored. The music herein is forgettable at best, and the dancing owes more to Las Vegas posturing than Broadway or discotheques. Perhaps Soderbergh was the wrong director for the project, which was an odd choice for the man who made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" Magic Mike's story is unexpectedly downbeat, and the angst of a frustrated furniture designer is low on entertainment value. While the film will likely draw and disappoint gay and female audiences, perhaps men can relate most to Mike and his checkered career in pursuit of a dream However, few straight men will venture into a movie with the advertising and subject matter of ""Magic Mike.""",steven soderbergh magic mike short need magic promis backstag tale male stripper conjur imag sexi men pulsat music erot choreographi unfortun expect companion piec flashdanc footloos even full monti magic mike compet play chan tatum construct worker day stripper night furnitur design ambit fellow hard hat construct site adam play alex pettyf drawn mike stripper world lure easi money even easier sex littl unexpect happen audienc nake male flesh sexual coupl better serv local porn shop dialog lame often deliv listlessli perhap stripper friend low key charact talk like mike friend eye glaze brain go numb nearli two hour spent compani physic fit matthew mcconaughey look almost cadaver dalla stripper tough manag howev mcconaughey effect scene resuscit film screen briefli despit age mcconaughey vulgar move erot gyrat sexual aura suppos stripper lack magic mike drag seem longer soderbergh insert arti shot gener fail even captur excit flashdanc glossi construct worker cum dancer featur length music video move beat never bore music herein forgett best danc owe la vega postur broadway discothequ perhap soderbergh wrong director project odd choic man made traffic erin brockovich magic mike stori unexpectedli downbeat angst frustrat furnitur design low entertain valu film like draw disappoint gay femal audienc perhap men relat mike checker career pursuit dream howev straight men ventur movi advertis subject matter magic mike

Magic Mike had that old old plot line character study---The main character finally takes a good look at his sorted life while his new protégée seems to follow in his footsteps and is destined to replace him. That ole character switcheroo story has been done in endless plots. The acting is not bad but very very dry. Adam's sister always carries the same expression of disapproval throughout the whole movie while Adam---even through he is the new kid on the block---just keeps looking clueless and insipid with no emotion or expression at all.

Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike has aspirations to start legitimate businesses, including a custom furniture venture, but must work in the strictly cash male strip club world, in order to fund his other enterprises.Mike takes nineteen-year-old Adam under his wing who's just lost his construction job. Mike falls for Adam's medical assistant sister, Brooke, who looks at his involvement in male stripping with disdain. The film's sub-plot involves Mike's inner struggle to leave his sleazy lifestyle and court Brooke, who represents everything good, wholesome and clean.The main plot of the film involves Adam's fall from grace as he becomes seduced by drug dealers who peddle ecstasy. Adam and Mike perform at a private sorority party and are attacked by the sorority girls' boyfriends, who discover that Adam has been giving ecstasy to some of the girls. During this altercation, Adam leaves a bag worth $10,000 of ecstasy pills at the party and later Mike must pay off drug dealers who are now looking to get even with Adam.At film's end, Adam opts to move to Miami with Dallas who has opened up a bigger and better club. Mike finally has an epiphany that he'll never be able to realize his dreams as a legitimate business owner if he remains in the male strip club world and leaves Dallas and that world for Brooke, who is grateful that Mike bailed out her brother.If you're into male stripping (which I am not), this might be your cup of tea. There are plenty of scenes featuring the male strippers performing in various costumes, suggesting different venues. The female audience at the club seem to get off on the acts of simulated sex, but I suspect that most men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional. In addition to her devotion to her brother, she represents the wholesome world which Mike aspires to be part of. Hence, Cody Horn as Brooke, has little to do except wait for Mike as he finally transforms himself at the film's climax.Director Steven Soderbergh appears to be ambivalent about the male stripping world he's commenting on. On one hand, he recognizes that such a world is sleazy due to its many connections to the criminal element. For example, Adam's fall from grace is a direct result of his association with such elements. On the other hand, Soderbergh appears to revel in the actual performances of these male strippers (as evidenced by the amount of performance scenes he opts to include in his film). In the end, I wonder if exploring the male strip club world is worthy of a feature length film. Perhaps a documentary might have been more effective. Soderbergh's rather simplistic tale of redemption cannot offset the vacuousness of the world he has chosen to explore.",magic mike refer protagonist film mike lane play chan tatum mike bud entrepreneur tampa florida partner perform male strip club run top owner dalla matthew mcconaughey mike aspir start legitim busi includ custom furnitur ventur must work strictli cash male strip club world order fund enterpris mike take nineteen year old adam wing lost construct job mike fall adam medic assist sister brook look involv male strip disdain film sub plot involv mike inner struggl leav sleazi lifestyl court brook repres everyth good wholesom clean main plot film involv adam fall grace becom seduc drug dealer peddl ecstasi adam mike perform privat soror parti attack soror girl boyfriend discov adam give ecstasi girl alterc adam leav bag worth ecstasi pill parti later mike must pay drug dealer look get even adam film end adam opt move miami dalla open bigger better club mike final epiphani never abl realiz dream legitim busi owner remain male strip club world leav dalla world brook grate mike bail brother male strip might cup tea plenti scene featur male stripper perform variou costum suggest differ venu femal audienc club seem get act simul sex suspect men watch stuff find big bore one problem stori brook charact pretti much one dimension addit devot brother repres wholesom world mike aspir part henc codi horn brook littl except wait mike final transform film climax director steven soderbergh appear ambival male strip world comment one hand recogn world sleazi due mani connect crimin element exampl adam fall grace direct result associ element hand soderbergh appear revel actual perform male stripper evidenc amount perform scene opt includ film end wonder explor male strip club world worthi featur length film perhap documentari might effect soderbergh rather simplist tale redempt cannot offset vacuous world chosen explor

Also, if you have had major mental health issues, or breakdowns this is your trigger warning.The movie reminds me of a long, confusing nightmare. In dreams there are rarely beginnings, middles or ends. This movie explores the mental challenges of having a child. I'm not a parent, but everyone's experience is different and has its own challenges. In this film, the baby crying (it starts quickly in the plot so it's not a spoiler) is, at least to me where the breakdown starts.Overall it's like watching a nightmare. Part horror, part character study, part surrealist, but overall it doesn't really come together.

406,Baby Ruby,classification should add horror,8,"This film almost slipped underneath my radar. It isn't classified as a horror flick but it really is horror. At least the horror metatag should be added to it. I would avoid the trailer if you can because, umm, the trailer just gives the story away and ruins it like they often do.What brought me to try it were some of the cast members in it. Most notably is Kit Harington from Game of Thrones fame when he played Jon Snow. I like Jayne Atkinson's style too.If you haven't seen the trailer which I recommend you don't. The tension in the story crescendo as the online influencer, Jo, spirals down into madness caused by postpartum depression. We see her anxiety about motherhood and the baby. We experience her paranoia and her unbalance mental health. This isn't a jump scare flick, but a slow burn film, just like I want them. Some of the freight scenes I have not seen in other horror films that genuine shook me. Not easy to do since I watch hundreds of horror films.

408,Baby Ruby,Exploring Postpartum Issues with Horror and Melodrama,5,"A debut film from playwright Bess Wohl that focuses on a French lifestyle blogger named Jo, who experiences postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. After giving birth to her baby Ruby, Jo begins to feel that her newborn is hostile towards her and she is unable to shake the feeling. The film keeps a close first-person perspective, showing Jo's increasingly paranoid mindset through shock cuts and hallucinatory elements, leaving the audience to question what is real and what is not. The movie's intent is to address the struggles that many new mothers face, but the constant use of horror tropes like pot boiling on the stove and repetitive ""did I just dream it or did it really happen"" moments drain away the power from the underlying message.The film's real bite comes from its cultural observation of entitled girl boss culture, the ""pick me girl"" turned new mom, and the private citizen acting like a celebrity/expert, but these elements are presented more as background noise rather than the main event. Ultimately, ""Baby Ruby"" falls short of fully exploring these important cultural issues and instead focuses on the horror and melodramatic elements of Jo's postpartum struggles.",debut film playwright bess wohl focus french lifestyl blogger name jo experi postpartum depress postpartum psychosi give birth babi rubi jo begin feel newborn hostil toward unabl shake feel film keep close first person perspect show jo increasingli paranoid mindset shock cut hallucinatori element leav audienc question real movi intent address struggl mani new mother face constant use horror trope like pot boil stove repetit dream realli happen moment drain away power underli messag film real bite come cultur observ entitl girl boss cultur pick girl turn new mom privat citizen act like celebr expert element present background nois rather main event ultim babi rubi fall short fulli explor import cultur issu instead focus horror melodramat element jo postpartum struggl
409,Baby Ruby,Psychological PND Film,5,"I thought this sounded like an interesting concept, social media has baby and things go wrong is what I got from the synopsis.The film kind of went how I expected but lacked or even included too many things for it to be a good film.It lacked meat on the bones of the overall storytelling from her backstory to her life in general. It included too many different characters and themes without managing to nail any of them.It has a fairly dark dreary look which can add to the tone of a film and its not something I dislike but its done in a fairly weak manner that it never really hits you with any impact.When the focus here is on the lead actress you really need a great lead and Noémie Merlant never pulls it off. The melancholic feels are all there but everything else is just placid. The rest of the cast ( including Kit Harrington ) are bit players and often overlooked or put in a corner once their purpose has been served. Many of which serve little purpose that really get to you in an unnerving way as intended.You could remove a few characters and give others more to do and Im sure the impact would have been greater. I don't know an awful lot about Post Natal Depression so its difficult to comment on the realism in how it was used.

415,Jurassic World:Dominion,"A generic, lifeless adventure movie that happens to have dinosaurs",3,"If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion.

418,Jurassic World:Dominion,They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park,6,"When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.",go jurass park movi want someth els hyper realist dinosaur cool environ see frolic natur habitat defend territori battl dino domin hunt human like open island scene brachiosauru rex reveal rainstorm dinosaur front center origin jurass park inspir sens grandeur awe dinosaur matter everyth els peripher even plot get island want anoth glimps rex anxiou discov raptor lurk first one sixth instal dinosaur releg commerci product seen everi tv screen movi demot human genet even mutat locust term import two half hour movi one would expect dinosaur fill almost half time yet pale screen time comparison human charact instead director tri insert cameo legaci charact forc interact honestli cringey dialogu shift focu away real mean jurass park franchis awe dinosaur wonder gone given six star respect franchis limit appear favorit dinosaur sad see director forgot made jurass park special first place

420,Jurassic World:Dominion,"""Your screenwriters were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.""",3,"Honestly, I could have adapted any number of great Dr. Malcolm quotes from the other films to title this review, but this one perhaps sums it up best. (Be warned. I have a lot to say, so if you dislike long reviews, skip ahead now.)Here's where I'm coming from:1. Loved Jurassic Park, of course.2. Enjoyed Lost World but disappointed by its missed potential.3. LIKED Jurassic Park III (that's right, I'm the guy).4. Admired Jurassic World for recreating some of the awe of the original with a slight twist.5. Frustrated with Fallen Kingdom's disjointed structure and simplistic characters but its cliffhanger ending left me optimistic for the future.6. Dominion... Well, another Malcolm quote sums it up: ""That is one big pile of s**t.""The Jurassic World trilogy unfortunately has been one of diminishing returns. The first (JW) was a reimaging of the 1993 original (not unlike The Force Awakens was to A New Hope), but with an understanding of modern cynicism and apathy. An early line of dialogue summed up the theme: ""No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore."" Genetically creating a new scarier hybrid dinosaur was an interesting angle, as it kept the scientific focus of the original but provided a meta commentary not just on the JP franchise but on all Hollywood monster movies. While it was no masterpiece, Colin Trevorrow gave a new idea to ponder alongside the dinos, which neither Lost World nor JP III did.Fallen Kingdom was very messy. Since JW resolved its plot quite well, new storylines and characters were created out of thin air, and logic was pretty much thrown out the window. John Hammond had a partner? The island houses an active volcano? Human cloning going back years? Claire now works for PETA for dinosaurs? The last surviving raptor is John McClane? A Freddy Krueger like dinosaur was created that hunts children in their beds for the purpose of...military combat? Yet, for all of Fallen Kingdom's problems, J. A. Bayona at least gave us some new atmosphere and ended on an intriguing note. By releasing the dinosaurs into the mainland, the door was left open for a number of interesting directions to take the final film.What's baffling about Dominion is how it manages, at great effort, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (pardon the pun). It was supposed to be the franchise's grand denouement. The set up was there--a fastball down the middle --and instead of a homer they hit a long popup to left field while the audience waits with increasing disappointment for the inevitable catch. I didn't care to research what went wrong with Dominion's planning process, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple scripts with different ideas, and Trevorrow (back in the director's chair, and again one of the writers) decided ""let's use them all!...except for the one that examines the logistics of dinosaurs living amongst humans...that one can be trashed.""As other reviewers have discussed, dinosaurs are merely tangential to Dominion's messy plot. For much of the 2 1/2 hour runtime, it's easy to forget about them, since instead the film decides to focus on...the human characters (and locusts?). Aside from the original, the JP movies have had a consistent problem with its human roles, most either being annoying, doing inexplicably stupid things (even the good guys, Nick Van Owen, anyone?), or just being plain boring. It's the last one that hurts Dominion the most.In JW, Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Howard) were stereotypical but capable leads with some humorous interactions. Fallen Kingdom stripped away most of Owen's charisma and gave Claire's personality an unwelcome 180. In Dominion, Owen is now Generic Action Hero, and Claire has made a full transformation from Take-Charge Corporate Executive to a worried mother (over a child who isn't hers) who screams and panics a lot with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) when encountering bugs. So much for women inherit the earth. Maisie (Sermon) also returns from Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, instead of focusing on her grappling with being the first human clone, they've reduced her to an unlikeable angsty teen who serves as a MacGuffin for the others after she's kidnapped by the bad guys for reasons not entirely clear.Bringing back the original cast is pointless if you give them nothing interesting to do. Dr. Grant (Neill) is perhaps the saddest case. In the 20 years since we've last seen him he is still digging up dinosaur fossils and apparently has done nothing else with his life. He has fallen from an intelligent, capable leader to a clueless figure who mostly follows others around looking as confused and bored as the audience. Dern as Dr. Sattler fares the best; she is given the most to do and tries to inject life into the nonsensical plot. Goldblum as Dr. Malcolm is a welcome return, but our favorite nonconformist chaotician would NEVER go work for a genetics lab. Near the film's end he provides an amusing commentary on the movie's absurdity (e.g., his deadpan to Pratt: ""You made a promise to a dinosaur?"")Two more returning roles need mention. One of the more interesting things JW and Fallen Kingdom did was bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), making him a brilliant but self-indulgent geneticist. Wong sold it very well and it seemed like a natural progression for his character. He felt Hammond never gave him the respect he deserved (like Nedry), so he became determined to make bigger and greater accomplishments (i.e., hybrid monsters) than his former boss, unabashedly and at any cost. It was an interesting heel turn, making Dr. Wu (while never a major role) the most believable human antagonist of the series. Instead of resolving Wu's villainous arc, Dominion inexplicably reverses course and strips him of his hubris. Looking ungodly sick, Wu gives a mea culpa to Maisie for his creation of...giant locusts. No mention of his regret for recklessly creating the hybrid killing machines in the last two movies. Another good set-up from prior movies wasted.And then there's Dr. Dodgson (Scott). JP enthusiasts will remember the character's cameo in the first JP as the competing geneticist who hires Nedry to steal the embryos. And true fans know he played a more prominent role in the second novel. It seemed like an inspired choice to bring back Dodgson, a villain who connects to the plot of the first film and, by proxy, to its three returning heroes. Yet, in his interactions in Dominion with Sattler, Grant, and Malcolm, they never learn of his involvement in JP. Indeed, even Dodgson doesn't seem aware that they were involved in JP, although his character should certainly know that. But for a quick shot of the infamous muddied Barbasol can in his office, you could completely forget who he is. He acts more like an eccentric Steve Jobs with only one foot in reality than the cutthroat scientist he should be. ""We've got Dodgson here!""...yet ""nobody cares."" Nedry was right.If you've read up to this point (congratulations), you'll note I've barely mentioned the dinosaurs. Say what you will about the other movies, but at least they were all about the dinos. Many had distinct personalities that made them terrifying. One of Fallen Kingdom's mistakes was recrafting the sole surviving raptor (the villains of the first JP) as the hero, and raptors are no longer scary. Dominion goes further. Now the raptor (Blue) has reproduced (don't ask) and is a doting mother. There's no menace, and, further, Blue is sidelined for most of the film.Yes, there are dinosaurs, including other types of raptors. Dominion takes Fallen Kingdom's lame concept of laser-guided raptors and embraces it, resulting in a motorcycle/cargo plane chase through Malta that, while visually impressive (and welcome as the first action sequence 45 minutes in), belongs in a Bond or Bourne movie. (Dominion hops across several genres.)Where these never-before-seen dinosaurs came from is unknown. No more than 50 were released in Fallen Kingdom, and these new species were not among them. No explanation...moving on. Some new dinos in Dodgson's ""animal preserve"" (*cough* new park) seem interesting, although we don't know anything about them. To the film's credit, there is a tensely shot sequence involving Claire hiding in a lake from a spine-chilling carnivore. It's the closest Dominion comes to recreating the quiet fear of the original, and it's due to the movie deciding to slow down and take a welcome breath.Though why this lake is liquid when another lake in the same general area and time is frozen over enough to walk on shows a lack of continuity. It feels as though the creative team became entirely overwhelmed with the snowballing plot threads and characters that inconsistencies like this became commonplace. Trevorrow reportedly was pleased Covid delayed the film's release a year because it would allow them more time in post-production, yet with the uneven editing and overall breakneck pace, you wouldn't know it. They had extra time to edit together a cohesive, understandable plot and failed to do so.But Dominion's biggest sin is that it simply isn't scary. Aside from the noted lake sequence, there is no terror, no dread, no sense of dangerous awe. A new apex predator bigger than the T-Rex is supposed to frighten us. It doesn't. When the paths of the JP leads and JW leads finally merge while cornered by the big dinos, they act like they're in peril, but we don't buy it. We don't believe any of these stars will die (they don't), and we're not invested enough in them to care anyway. The characters lack agency, and it's boring. Dominion mostly swaps quiet scenes of terror of humans using their wits to face off against dinos (e.g., JP's T-Rex escape, raptors in the kitchen) for interchangeable dinos fighting each other in yawn-inducing brawls.During one of these, Dr. Grant notes aloud: ""This isn't about us."" How true, and how sad.

421,Jurassic World:Dominion,Absolute trash,2,"This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well.

422,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Wayne Knight said it best three decades ago: We got Dodgson here, and nobody cares.",4,"I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.",know whether fabl memori year ago think read interview director colin trevorrow said stori dominion alway ultim go jurass world fallen kingdom step stone almost gather right build charact fan anticip budget technolog advanc everi reason imagin believ fallen kingdom end endless opportun explor world dinosaur run amok caus mayhem final shot fallen kingdom includ rex zoo mosasauru attack surfer velociraptor overlook suburban california pterodactyl tower tourist popul la vega think lost world san diego epilogu grander scale dinosaur throw militari philosoph convers regard erad versu surviv advanc charact bona fide fun summer blockbust happen matter actual opinion film hereon help letdown disappoint trevorrow either delud believ kind conclus fan yearn ala war planet ape much compel protagonist make work despit stori misdirect j bayona pull rian johnson put corner conclud chapter rectifi actual written plan medium stori work fine imagin main plot element adapt say novel comic seri hell even battl big rock short done could told element least introduc instead threw extrem disjoint stori bit final chapter seem sourc origin felt like contriv meant unit two charact group noth dominion start okay show slow genuin heartbeat provid patho exist reptilian brethren trot globe see integr speci reintroduc charact new old possibl intern conflict show would pave globetrot path even fix poorli written aspect fallen kingdom matur franklin charact give better use laser target attack system give maisi believ backstori support fantast animatron work much improv cgi blend thought visual mostli knockout support onscreen setup sam neill laura dern jeff goldblum kindl similar flame interact jp sat forward watch moment caught smile quit time exchang jeff goldblum especi use well abl inject entertain comedi dialogu film otherwis flat attempt small cameo appear serv crucial role film buy live even though tlw jp retcon actor clearli tap experi perform accentu status speak buy would given film long leash lot thing could done movi hit point embrac ridicul sever place want make blue becom owen pet attack guard go right ahead want modern action give protagonist abil skill might see fast furiou franchis human marvel hero dinosaur get larg share action well board malta scene perfect exampl want pay homag previou film conclud franchis expect also expect diversifi tonal level need becom stale think feel hell nearli half hour durat singl dinosaur shown brought anticip come build charact stori let play problem realli aros movi decid abandon broad peregrin experi confin set dominion saga epic conclus need put hat major rug pull anticip sour spend excruciatingli long time someth left littl entertain tension dinosaur show moment becom littl one note good guy plot armor raptor run vehicl speed catch run charact corner get roar ran flown swam past find way situat know stand around trust carnivor eat reason bryce dalla howard got best suspens dino encount stage film actual work extrem well near minut movi far franchis realli sit ask chanc surviv instanc lot could made better rexi got great moment even backdrop upstag often matter come screen seem rehash occurr someth old look sound good though want restat good dinosaur actual look want commend visual effect depart abl depart niggl would probabl weight raptor movement felt light jitteri probabl make sens head rest look realli good know would wait year jurass park iii final get sequel visual realli soar would gladli take wish better film least film would want rewatch instead left aftertast make want instead go watch top gun maverick fourth time outsid demo materi even know completionist get uhd month line normal one fault film let specul becom expect particular instanc much believ sign promot hint toward differ kind movi stori despit good part much misguid ineffectu whimper

425,Jurassic World:Dominion,"As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".",3,"I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct.

426,Jurassic World:Dominion,Jurassic World Dominion,1,"Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money.",easili least favorit movi jurass park saga absolut horribl ever level fundament misunderstand make saga interest trevorrow clue movi told make final film six movi saga said hmm let focu dinosaur final film understand peopl want see movi need actual focu dinosaur gonna keep peopl attent feel happen instead film focus giant locust interest need sidelin dinosaur want see espionag stori kidnap locust clone want see world would like dinosaur took see either main issu happen previou film chang statu quo bare focus besid scene baffl would even origin cast save jeff goldblum sam neill seem like fun dialogu given horrend dialogu gener bad got worst whole cast gener seem tri besid neill goldblum everyon felt low energi want villain gave worst perform film let guy spitbal awkward line know say cut film feel rel low stake well feel like final like bad epilogu fallen kingdom feel like final movi bad build final dinosaur battl well appar set prologu releas year ago decid cut movi decid cut scene show conflict differ speci dinosaur yeah great job guy help film mindlessli bore well deserv half hour runtim train wreck film watch even like origin film wast money

They added giant locust in this one, so there's that. But really there was no reason to make this film. It's the same dinosaurs. The same dinosaur sounds.

The same dramatic drawn out camera angles on the actors faces as they look either scared, concerned or all-knowing before scrambling to safety just in the nick of time.

428,Jurassic World:Dominion,As generic as Hollywood 'blockbusters' come. And I've seen a lot of 'em.,3,"Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon.",jurass world dominion feel like becam self parodi first act movi sure nice referenc past movi kind laps logic annoy deu ex machina play appar brainless charact dinosaur becom part earth everyday socioeconom hemispher wast opportun felt like mislead teas fallen kingdom potenti unit two gener jurass park cast unit dinosaur fight surviv mayb even show fallout situat dinosaur actual co exist alongsid peopl jurass franchis definit exhaust possibl point time think know univers least consid anoth sequel conclus next jurass star take dinosaur liter outer space someth least provid iron entertain becom midnight movi phenomenon
429,Jurassic World:Dominion,"No respect for popcuture and cineastic art - please, let the modern Hollywood go extinct",1,"Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history.

430,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Too long, some neat set-pieces",6,"I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10.",say colin trevorrow unlik hollywood writer director seem activ spite toward classic saga write sequel trevorrow say fan jurass park believ jurass world dominion feel good ill like world expens fan film cram nearli everi dinosaur known man everi charact meme joke previou five movi button shirt malcom get hat grant oh look nedri old barbasol bet great pete postlethwait pass away would gotten roland tembo rappel helicopt shoot oviraptor face movi least twenti minut long hollywood seem incap make non bloat blockbust today even bond movi run time thin red line shred wit intellig belov first jurass park like set piec therizinosauru frozen lake alway nice see awesom sam neill back guess fan bait work extent

434,Jurassic World:Dominion,Avoid Like the Plague,3,"Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one.

437,Jurassic World:Dominion,Are we serious?!,2,"Truly a shameful film made in a hurry and without a plot that is linear or otherwise makes sense. Since Jurassic World in 2015 the Jurassic saga has gone to die, with dinosaurs that were better made in 1993 and with characters that try to retrace the steps of the main protagonists of Jurassic Park but fail to even be iconic for the film itself. Somebody has to stop them, they are ruining a saga that was never supposed to be revived again, it was over in 2001 and I still ask myself now, ""but was it really needed?"" I sincerely hope that this is the last chapter, although I'm afraid not, because really how can you put locusts as the villain of the movie... ARE WE KIDDING? I would have expected anything, but locusts don't.

438,Blonde,Blonde,5,"What a truly disappointing film this is. It offers us a really slow, sterile and disjointed - almost episodic - depiction of just how Marilyn Monroe's life might have panned out. For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women.",truli disappoint film offer us realli slow steril disjoint almost episod depict marilyn monro life might pan start decid whether ana de arma realli ladi gaga scarlett johansson would acquit better say offer admittedli intens remark uninvolv perform move along chapter chapter life hinder fairli weak uninspir dialogu serious intrus score becom increasingli shallow lacklustr fashion photographi tri hard offer us sens intimaci whole thing present stylis un natur manner frequent difficult tell whether real woman marriag treat almost scant manner relationship jfk reduc someth rather implaus one side sordid show noth relationship might come soul film asid glamour even hardli uniqu realli introduc nuanc charact left guess lot time becom superstar spiral inevit maelstrom booz pill reli consider extent viewer exist knowledg affect flaw ladi adrien brodi bobbi cannaval realli much chanc add anyth husband highli specul relationship charli chaplin jnr xavier samuel sexual ambigu partner crime edward g robinson jr scoot mcnairi suggest someth rather proflig debauch exist live hollywood charact also larg undercook larg left use imagin far far long pack cinema could see peopl look ceil often watchabl certainli real miss opportun offer us someth scintil tantalis icon women
439,Blonde,Poor Marilyn,5,"If you're going to fictionalize the life of one of the movie icons of the 20th century why go there, to the darkest dark. There are some ""invented"" moments that are, quite frankly, unforgivable. What kept me glued to the screen was Ana de Armas. A tremendous show of talent and fearlessness. I was wondering what the experience would have been to watch it in a theater with other people? I don't know because in the privacy of my own home I was free to stand up and walk away to pour myself a drink and shout at the screen. The awful Kennedy episode for instance. Why? That episode in particular made me question the intention of the filmmakers. So, yes, I can say now that I've seen it.

440,Blonde,"A disjointed, episodic look at Monroe's miseries! [+42%]",4,"""Blonde"" is sadly reduced to the collective tragedies (and horrors) that the iconic actress went through in her short 36-year-old life. Don't get me wrong, Ana de Armas totally owns the role and gives it her all (God bless her cheekbones!). She also gets worthwhile support from the cinematography, production design, costume, and make-up departments. The biggest letdown is the script that heavily lacks connective tissue between what feels like various disjointed episodes in Monroe's life. Again, each of these episodes are stripped down to repetitive plot-points such as the absentee father, the abortions, the failed marriages, and most importantly, the male gaze.Writer-director Andrew Dominik perceives Marilyn Monroe and Norma Jeane as two distinct personas, the former being a glowy, on-screen cover-up for the distressed latter. Again, because the film is only interested in showcasing the worst of her life, as viewers, we feel disconnected early on, especially given the film goes on for a butt-numbing 160 minutes. Also, I didn't particularly like the transition between black & white and color bang in the middle of certain scenes. What was the underlying point? The film basically leaves Armas to do most of the heavy lifting since the script only attempts to look at her as an object of desire.Of course, there are more than a few controversial stretches in the film, and if that's barring a scene with a speaking foetus, then I'm probably dreaming it all up. This isn't what Norma would've wanted to be seen as her ""legacy"", and both entries Netflix has come up with thus far on Marilyn Monroe (yes, I'm looking at you The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes) are lacklustre.",blond sadli reduc collect tragedi horror icon actress went short year old life get wrong ana de arma total own role give god bless cheekbon also get worthwhil support cinematographi product design costum make depart biggest letdown script heavili lack connect tissu feel like variou disjoint episod monro life episod strip repetit plot point absente father abort fail marriag importantli male gaze writer director andrew dominik perceiv marilyn monro norma jean two distinct persona former glowi screen cover distress latter film interest showcas worst life viewer feel disconnect earli especi given film goe butt numb minut also particularli like transit black white color bang middl certain scene underli point film basic leav arma heavi lift sinc script attempt look object desir cours controversi stretch film bar scene speak foetu probabl dream norma would want seen legaci entri netflix come thu far marilyn monro ye look mysteri marilyn monro unheard tape lacklustr

442,Blonde,Monotone and unbalanced piece,2,"I knew this was meant to be divisive but I didn't expect to dislike it this much.Technically it is mostly well crafted (except for the very questionable editing). The acting is good - Ana de Armas is great, in fact -, but this script is terrible. I mean, I can understand what the director tried to achieve with this. I get the goals - he wanted to show all the tragedies in her life and how that culminated in the way she was and she ended her life. But it is so focused on the same single note over and over again that it is tedious and, to be honest, gives you very few reasons to keep watching. We already knew this wouldn't be a happy portrayal of Marilyn, but lacks any kind of balance to be a good work. I have no doubts that this was a big part of who she was, but she was much more than that and this film refuses to acknowledge that even with almost 3 hours of runtime.Stupidly long for what it tries to say - that is clear with 15 minutes -, tiring and never an engaging piece. One of those films that I am 100% sure I will never revisit it.PS: That blowjob scene is...uncomfortable, but, above all, pathetic.

443,Blonde,buck up for this one,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have studied Marilyn Monroe's personal and professional life, writer-director Andrew Dominik's (first feature film since KILLING THEM SOFTLY, 2012) interpretative adaptation of the 2000 novel by Joyce Carol Oates may send them into the early stages of shock. In fact, regardless of one's level of knowledge of the details of Marilyn's background, shock and bewilderment are likely reactions. It should be made clear for all viewers that it's a fictionalized account of her life, not a true biography. One should also know that this is cinematic artistic mastery to complement an incredibly in-depth and revolutionary performance from Ana de Armas (KNIVES OUT, 2019, NO TIME TO DIE, 2021).At times, the film is surreal, while at others, downright hallucinatory. It's certainly never boring. However, it's a disturbing beatdown and a grueling watch for a single sitting at close to three hours long. The film begins in 1933 with a young Norma Jeane (Lily Fisher) living in poverty and misery with her single mom Gladys (a terrific Julianne Nicholson). Mom has obvious mental issues and would much prefer Norma Jeane not be around. It's here where the 'Daddy issues' take hold - issues that stick with the girl for the remainder of her life. After being rejected by her father, her mother, and the friendly neighbors, Norma Jeane ends up in an orphanage. A montage takes us through her teenage modeling years, where we see the beginnings of her being taken advantage of and treated as a commodity.There is an extended sequence involving the threesome of Marilyn and the sons of Hollywood legends Charlie Chaplin and Edward G Robinson (Xavier Samuel, Evan Williams, respectively), and a vicious rape scene with a studio head ""Mr. Z"" (hmmm). Marilyn's first pregnancy leads to an abortion, which is the first of a few tragedies she will experience - and director Dominik finds an entirely new (and bizarre) method of filming these occurrences. The Joe DiMaggio (Bobby Cannavale) and Arthur Miller (Oscar winner Adrien Brody) marriages are noted, yet the men go unnamed, instead referred to as ""former athlete"" and ""playwright"" ... as if somehow that will trick us.Of course, all of these relationships are right in line with her ""Daddy issues"" ... Marilyn even goes so far as to call these men ""Daddy"", in hopes that one will finally give her the love and acceptance she so craves. One of the more uncomfortable scenes (and that's saying something) involves her tryst with JFK (also unnamed), played by Caspar Phillipson, whose uncanny resemblance to the former President has resulted in his casting for the role in multiple projects. It's likely this White House moment, replete with Marilyn's inner voice, is responsible for the film's NC-17 rating.Dominik and cinematographer Chase Irvin recreate some of the most memorable film moments from Marilyn's career ... including the subway vent scene from THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. After capturing that film magic, the sequence seems to drag on with leering onlookers and what proved to be the final straw with DiMaggio. A recurring feature involves Marilyn receiving and reading letters from the father she's never met - including promises of meeting ""soon."" The payoff for this is disappointing for us and for her.Perhaps the main point of Dominik's movie is the enormous gulf and psychological contrast between Norma Jeane, the eternally-scarred young girl, and Marilyn Monroe, the iconic bombshell she created for public consumption. There is a sadness about her most of the time, even when she flips that switch to become Marilyn - the familiar sultress adored by so many. Toby Huss plays Whitey, a version of real-life Allan Snyder, who was Marilyn's long-time make-up artist and confidant. Her famous diary gets a mention, and we see the price she paid for taking drugs to calm anxiety while dealing with the crushing weight of fame.Ana de Armas delivers a performance for the ages. Of course, the scrutiny she will face playing one of the most famous women of all-time will be senselessly nitpicky, yet from an artistic standpoint, her work is supreme. Costume Designer Jennifer Johnson somehow manages to nail the different stages, films, and moods (of both the film and its subject). Is this exploiting the woman who made a career out of being exploited? Or is it simply telling a story? Norma Jeane was a fragile creature constantly victimized as she desperately searched for love. Has the filmmaker continued that abuse with this vision? From a moviemaking aspect, it's' a thing of beauty. From a human perspective, it's torturous to watch. If you are in need of a 'feel-good' movie, keep searching. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for the work of a cinematic visionary and one of the best acting performances of the year, settle in.Opens on Netflix September 23, 2022.",greet dark studi marilyn monro person profession life writer director andrew dominik first featur film sinc kill softli interpret adapt novel joyc carol oat may send earli stage shock fact regardless one level knowledg detail marilyn background shock bewilder like reaction made clear viewer fiction account life true biographi one also know cinemat artist masteri complement incred depth revolutionari perform ana de arma knive time die time film surreal other downright hallucinatori certainli never bore howev disturb beatdown gruel watch singl sit close three hour long film begin young norma jean lili fisher live poverti miseri singl mom gladi terrif juliann nicholson mom obviou mental issu would much prefer norma jean around daddi issu take hold issu stick girl remaind life reject father mother friendli neighbor norma jean end orphanag montag take us teenag model year see begin taken advantag treat commod extend sequenc involv threesom marilyn son hollywood legend charli chaplin edward g robinson xavier samuel evan william respect viciou rape scene studio head mr z hmmm marilyn first pregnanc lead abort first tragedi experi director dominik find entir new bizarr method film occurr joe dimaggio bobbi cannaval arthur miller oscar winner adrien brodi marriag note yet men go unnam instead refer former athlet playwright somehow trick us cours relationship right line daddi issu marilyn even goe far call men daddi hope one final give love accept crave one uncomfort scene say someth involv tryst jfk also unnam play caspar phillipson whose uncanni resembl former presid result cast role multipl project like white hous moment replet marilyn inner voic respons film nc rate dominik cinematograph chase irvin recreat memor film moment marilyn career includ subway vent scene seven year itch captur film magic sequenc seem drag leer onlook prove final straw dimaggio recur featur involv marilyn receiv read letter father never met includ promis meet soon payoff disappoint us perhap main point dominik movi enorm gulf psycholog contrast norma jean etern scar young girl marilyn monro icon bombshel creat public consumpt sad time even flip switch becom marilyn familiar sultress ador mani tobi huss play whitey version real life allan snyder marilyn long time make artist confid famou diari get mention see price paid take drug calm anxieti deal crush weight fame ana de arma deliv perform age cours scrutini face play one famou women time senselessli nitpicki yet artist standpoint work suprem costum design jennif johnson somehow manag nail differ stage film mood film subject exploit woman made career exploit simpli tell stori norma jean fragil creatur constantli victim desper search love filmmak continu abus vision moviemak aspect thing beauti human perspect tortur watch need feel good movi keep search hand mood work cinemat visionari one best act perform year settl open netflix septemb
444,Blonde,Let Marilyn RIP,1,"Anyone who knew about or cared about Marilyn would have written a movie about a beautiful, vulnerable creature who came across as so lovable on the screen, yet never got the love she deserved from those close to her.If someone wants to make a twisted, raunchy movie, they are free to do so. What is wrong is to USE a famous icon to do it. The author of the book and the director/writer of the movie could have created a fictional Monroe type character but they chose not to. Why? Because they knew if they exploited a beloved icon they'd get far more attention. They are p*mping this poor woman.Marilyn Monroe had a difficult, unstable and lonely childhood. She had no one to protect her and no one to guide her. She struggled long and hard to become a star. She was built up by a studio who saw her looks, charisma and raw talent. She was basically a piece of meat to them.The public adored her, but she had to struggle to cope and survive as a beautiful actress in 1950s Hollywood. She was mostly a gentle, sensitive soul. This obviously had to be difficult for her.She turned to pills to be able to sleep, and pills to keep her weight down. She was on a foggy roller coaster ride. She had friends who wouldn't or couldn't help her. The most desired woman in the world was basically alone to fight for herself. On top of that, I've read old movie magazine articles of the time calling her old at 36!Marilyn is still an icon 60 years since her death. Why? People still love watching her in her films. She personifies glamour, vulnerability and sensuality all in one. People identify with her vulnerability and some of the problems she faced. They also realize her untapped potential.This woman made people happy and made people laugh. She made mistakes like anyone else with no guidance and on their own. Still, she wasn't a ruthless, nasty person. I doubt she ever got as much as she gave.Let her rest. Don't make up some twisted story and use her tragedy to promote your book, movie or yourself.

445,Blonde,Bold and exceptionally well-made,8,"Blonde was already one of the most controversial and hotly debated films of the year before it hit Netflix, and therefore became available to the public at large. That's happened within the last day or two, and I expect that will blow up the discussion and discourse around it even more. It's probably going to be what most film news sites or discussion groups focus on for the next week or two, and maybe longer if it ends up earning some nominations for the upcoming awards season.I don't want to talk about the controversy too much, but it's important to address it briefly. Truthfully, I don't understand most of it. This film is shocking in parts, yes, but not as bad as a lot of the early discussions surrounding it made it sound. Almost none of the scenes that involve sex or nudity are presented in a titillating way, and they're all over quite quickly. There's very little about it that's supposed to be erotic, and I think that's evident by how the camera tends to lock onto Norma Jean's face, to emphasize the pain, discomfort, and trauma she feels during those scenes.So is it exploiting that pain, discomfort, and trauma? That seems to be the other big talking point. I didn't think so. I think the film was sympathetic to her, and aimed to showcase how misogynistic the film industry was at the time Norma Jean/Marilyn Monroe was active within it. It's arguably not much better nowadays, but whether these exact things happened to her or not feels somewhat beside the point. The fact is, things similar to this did almost certainly happen to Monroe and other young actresses. That idea is horrifying, and I think the film successfully painted it as horrifying.Ana de Armas is fantastic in the lead role. She'll probably get some nominations come awards season. The rest of the cast are solid, the film is visually stunning from start to finish, and I loved the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (at least one track was a repurposed instrumental from Ghosteen, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' last album, but it fit so well I didn't mind).For complaints about the filmmaking itself? The nearly three-hour runtime might be a little indulgent, but for the most part it earns it. There are also some occasionally strange and baffling creative decisions, but for every one that doesn't work, there's at least several strange creative decisions that do.I thought Blonde was pretty great overall. I understand to a limited extent why it's become controversial, but can't wrap my head around the magnitude of that controversy. Still, if it's got people angry, I don't plan to wade into any discourse or make discussions more heated. I've defended it here and said my piece.

446,Blonde,Mixed feelings,7,Ana de armas gave an inspiring performance and she really acted her heart out. The story and it's execution was a masterpiece at places and the cinematography and aesthetics were on a new level. As I don't know that much about marlyn I don't actually care how they portrayed her. The main accomplishment of the film is that it shows the horrors of Hollywood masterfully and how sometimes famous people or actors lose themselves as a person underneath the limelight and become somewhat of a lost soul. In some respects they failed to make it feel impactful and it seemed disjointed sometimes. But to see ana de armas act her heart out and netflix do something new is truly refreshing.

447,Blonde,Why Tell Fictional Stories About a Real Person?,2,"Marilyn Monroe was a great artist and this movie could've been a great opportunity to teach younger audiences about who she was. But for some reason, they decide to tell a fictional story. She has the same name, plays in the same movies, and sings the same songs, but many events are made up. It's so misleading when movies do this. It's not a movie about Marilyn Monroe, it's a movie about a mentally ill actress. Monroe was more than a mentally ill sex symbol. She was intelligent and a great artist - which doesn't come across in this movie.Ana de Armas is okay in the movie. She looks and sounds like Monroe, but she is naked for an uncomfortable amount of time in the movie. It's not just the fact that she's naked, but she's naked for no apparent reason.

448,Blonde,Two Personalities in one Body,8,"I really liked it a lot.

Yes he gave us a different version of that known personaity however we never felt close to her. But i guess this might have been intentionally. Because can you be close to such an icon and legend - to the symbol of Hollywood?The length of the film did not bother me at all - in fact I was afraid a bioic that long that just focuses on one person could have lenghts.

Ana de Armas is so unmistakeable as Marilyn Monroe that it is eerie. The effects working her into the actual Monroe films are seamless. The supporting case of actors are wonderful. This is a heavy dark movie in so many ways. It is a biography, but it is also the struggle of Norma Jean to distinguish herself from Marilyn Monroe, the character. It is also and ode to love, and to finding peace and identity through love. This movie is unique and brilliant, but it is not for someone looking for an easily digestible, chronological telling of the life of Marilyn Monroe.

All the bad, ugly, dark and crazy, that's what they like to show us. No... they want to ram it down the viewers throat, again, and again, and again, and again. You think I'm being repetitive? Oh, that's nothing compared to the movie.Off course it's beautifully shot and DeArmas is a decent actress, but mostly overacting in this role. The side characters are bland at best but just not there most of the time. What made Marilyn such a great star? Well... they not gonna tell you in this movie. All they have time to do is give you the misery. And that's how you will be after watching this - miserable.",usual hollyweird goe overboard destroy anoth icon instead tell us bitter sweet settl bad bad ugli dark crazi like show us want ram viewer throat think repetit oh noth compar movi cours beauti shot dearma decent actress mostli overact role side charact bland best time made marilyn great star well gonna tell movi time give miseri watch miser
453,Blonde,Marilyn deserved better!,6,"Blonde review :A supposed biopic on the Hollywood diva Marilyn Monroe; Blonde has a scene where a group of snobbish oldies ask a young Monroe if her blonde hair is real? To which he hesitantly replies No. The moment is given a surreal touch depicting the insecurities of a star who had faced a troubled childhood and was a lonely loser beneath all that gloss and glamour.The film's biggest positive is of course Ana De Armas who literally gets in to the skin of the titular character. Her transformation from the diffident Norma Jeane to the movie star Marilyn is truly incredible and full marks to her for getting it bang on...brilliant indeed!Director Andrew Dominik doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Monroe's life whether it was her blatant exploitation by the filmmakers of that era or her illicit relationship with the President of United States. It's all there and in all its gory details!! Marilyn's ""threesome"" relationship is also explored uninhibitantly.On the flipside, the pacing is super slow and some scenes just don't make any sense. Like Norma hallucinating an abortion. Also, Monroe's (in)famous skirt blowing moment in The Seven Year Itch (1955) is filmed in multiple angles here with her undergarments on full display reeking of cheap titillation. Ooff!With all its plus and cons, Blonde aint too bad for a Netflix watch. It could've been a far better movie though.Regards,

454,Blonde,Disgusting,1,"This was so difficult to get through. It felt so messy and everything was one tone the entire way through, it was disaster after disaster with no room to breathe. I feel like even though this was a long film it didn't show who Monroe actually was, it focused on everything bad which I see what they were trying to do and what led her to taking her life but it was too much. There is also very sexual (sexual assault) scenes and they are so uncomfortable and unnecessary and felt a little disrespectful to show especially for that long! A lot of unnecessary nudity to be honest and abortion scenes which were too long and showed way too much and this happened 2/3 times it was horrific. This movie had these problems the entire way through and it was 3 hours! It was way too long for what we got, not worth the watch at all.",difficult get felt messi everyth one tone entir way disast disast room breath feel like even though long film show monro actual focus everyth bad see tri led take life much also sexual sexual assault scene uncomfort unnecessari felt littl disrespect show especi long lot unnecessari nuditi honest abort scene long show way much happen time horrif movi problem entir way hour way long got worth watch
455,Blonde,Ana de Armas Uncannily Channels Marilyn in an Overlong Movie Infused with Relentless Pain,8,"Look at her eyes. Look at the spot-on reenactments of her classic movie moments (especially ""Some Like It Hot""). Ana de Armas' transformation into Marilyn Monroe is devastating, heartbreaking, and so completely accurate that it comes across less as an imitation and more like an inhabitation of the legendary actress' soul. Lugubriously directed by Andrew Dominik, this overlong 2022 film is not a straight-up biopic but an episodic cautionary tale of pre-Harvey Weinstein abuse and power politics taken from a startling first-person perspective. Based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2001 novel, the story is not only tragic but painful to watch with trauma erupting in almost every scene. Look past de Armas' Oscar-worthy work if you can, and you'll see strong work from Julianne Nicholson as her disturbed mother and Adrien Brody as the Arthur Miller character. Why it received an NC-17 rating became clear toward the end.",look eye look spot reenact classic movi moment especi like hot ana de arma transform marilyn monro devast heartbreak complet accur come across less imit like inhabit legendari actress soul lugubri direct andrew dominik overlong film straight biopic episod cautionari tale pre harvey weinstein abus power polit taken startl first person perspect base joyc carol oat novel stori tragic pain watch trauma erupt almost everi scene look past de arma oscar worthi work see strong work juliann nicholson disturb mother adrien brodi arthur miller charact receiv nc rate becam clear toward end
456,Blonde,Unnecessarily Naked...,7,"A young woman, disturbed, tortured and scarred by her childhood; abused, exploited and manipulated by those she most trusts; anxious, afraid and troubled by what she really wants and what she actually has, spirals into chaos and despair, cascades into confusion and mayhem, and pays the ultimate price for fame and fortune, for pleasing others above herself, while sacrificing the innocence that endears her to the world.Longer than your typical movie, it's only through the compelling and gripping performance of Ana de Armas that it gets away with that longevity, although the subject matter of this grim, fictionalised telling generally captures most people's attention, but I'm not sure the exposure she gets throughout really adds to the value.",young woman disturb tortur scar childhood abus exploit manipul trust anxiou afraid troubl realli want actual spiral chao despair cascad confus mayhem pay ultim price fame fortun pleas other sacrif innoc endear world longer typic movi compel grip perform ana de arma get away longev although subject matter grim fictionalis tell gener captur peopl attent sure exposur get throughout realli add valu

458,Blonde,It's a horror movie not a biopic,8,"People who wanted a Marilyn biopic turn away. It's not that. The book on which the film is based is a creepy slink through the darkness of Hollywood and the machine of goddess creation. Those who think Marilyn Monroe was a good girl are naive and uninformed. She was a real woman with needs and addictions who lived pretty wildly for most of her life. The scenes with the talking fetus are not for me, and seem rather by rote and pro-life, representing a full baby when it would have been a few cells at the point of her abortions. Also cloying is the suggestion she was obsessed with finding her father, which was overplayed here.However, most of the movie Ana de Armas pulls off a brilliant performance, and although some on here have criticised her accent, it should be said that you are forgetting Marilyn worked on various accents with foreign lilts, just listen to her in Niagra and Some Like It Hot to hear her added Latina or French accents on words. Her voice changed depending on who she was talking with, and de Armas pulls this off, unfortunately her being Cuban will mean this clever trick will be misinterpreted as her doing the accent wrong.The violence and famous JFK scene is both grotesque and necessary, and reminded me of Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. This film doesn't destroy an icon but shows another side to her life, and how it would have been for women in Hollywood. Showing them as Vestals for gods was an interesting angle, and don't forget, from the book written by a woman.People are saying, can't there be some happy moments? But no, this film is about the darkness, and wants you to feel the pain she endures over and over while trying to exist. It gets Lars Von Trier dark at times.The scenes where Norma channels Marilyn are genius, and Neon Demon-like. Unfortunately, maybe sixty percent of people watching this film will insist on hating it, because they wanted it to be a biopic. Oh well. I'm glad it was made, even if it was a bit flawed.",peopl want marilyn biopic turn away book film base creepi slink dark hollywood machin goddess creation think marilyn monro good girl naiv uninform real woman need addict live pretti wildli life scene talk fetu seem rather rote pro life repres full babi would cell point abort also cloy suggest obsess find father overplay howev movi ana de arma pull brilliant perform although criticis accent said forget marilyn work variou accent foreign lilt listen niagra like hot hear ad latina french accent word voic chang depend talk de arma pull unfortun cuban mean clever trick misinterpret accent wrong violenc famou jfk scene grotesqu necessari remind lost highway mulholland drive film destroy icon show anoth side life would women hollywood show vestal god interest angl forget book written woman peopl say happi moment film dark want feel pain endur tri exist get lar von trier dark time scene norma channel marilyn geniu neon demon like unfortun mayb sixti percent peopl watch film insist hate want biopic oh well glad made even bit flaw
459,Blonde,Was Expecting Worse,6,"After all of the terrible Internet reviews, I was expecting much worse from ""Blonde."" While I agree that it's not a great, or maybe even very good, movie, it's not terrible, and I'll admit that things about it got under my skin and stayed there, which is always the sign of at least effective filmmaking.I'm sick to death of biopics, and I don't have much interest in Marilyn Monroe. I don't care for her style of acting, and I'm too young to have been witness to her cultural impact at the time she was living. So from the start I'm not the ideal audience for this movie. And I don't know that I fully understand the point of it. I didn't know going in that it was speculative fiction based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel, so I spent much of the running time wondering how accurate it was. It's a 3 hour marathon of nothing but terrible things happening to Monroe, and it all just starts to feel like exploitative misery porn without any point other than that the Hollywood industry treats people, especially women, badly, as if we didn't already know that. There seems to be some effort to show us that Monroe was more than just a dumb blonde, but a feeble effort at best. We don't really ever get to know her or understand her inner life, so she mostly remains an object for the film to abuse. It really just made me feel bad, and I'm tired of seeing movies this year that seem to exist for the sole purpose of making their audiences feel bad. There's been a lot of them.Ana de Armas sure gives herself to the role, but I started to feel almost embarrassed by all the things the movie made her do, and did to her. After a while it felt like I was walking in on her in the middle of a bowel movement. As I write this, de Armas was just nominated for an Oscar for her performance. I don't begrudge her the nomination, because A for effort I guess, though hers wasn't one of my particular favorite performances of the year. And she can't lose her accent for anything.But like I said upfront, the movie did manage to make me feel something, even if that something was mostly bad, which is more than a lot of films do.Grade: C+",terribl internet review expect much wors blond agre great mayb even good movi terribl admit thing got skin stay alway sign least effect filmmak sick death biopic much interest marilyn monro care style act young wit cultur impact time live start ideal audienc movi know fulli understand point know go specul fiction base joyc carol oat novel spent much run time wonder accur hour marathon noth terribl thing happen monro start feel like exploit miseri porn without point hollywood industri treat peopl especi women badli alreadi know seem effort show us monro dumb blond feebl effort best realli ever get know understand inner life mostli remain object film abus realli made feel bad tire see movi year seem exist sole purpos make audienc feel bad lot ana de arma sure give role start feel almost embarrass thing movi made felt like walk middl bowel movement write de arma nomin oscar perform begrudg nomin effort guess though one particular favorit perform year lose accent anyth like said upfront movi manag make feel someth even someth mostli bad lot film grade c
460,Blonde,Enough of the Marilyn Monroe Exploitation,1,"Marilyn Monroe was exploited in life, and she's being mega-exploited in death. Blonde is pure unadulterated exploitation of a woman who simply should be left alone to rest in peace. I don't care what Ana De Armas or that bloviating director tries to say about this film or the multitude of excuses they use...it's trash. The entire film is a lesson in exploitation 101. De Armas is not at all convincing as Monroe and the utterly despicable scenes in Blond would make Attila the Hun cringe and look away. There's nothing more to say except...I hope this disrespectful piece of dreck is the last time someone tries to make money on Marilyn Monroe by constantly exploiting her and dragging her out of her grave just because they can. Enough is enough.",marilyn monro exploit life mega exploit death blond pure unadulter exploit woman simpli left alon rest peac care ana de arma bloviat director tri say film multitud excus use trash entir film lesson exploit de arma convinc monro utterli despic scene blond would make attila hun cring look away noth say except hope disrespect piec dreck last time someon tri make money marilyn monro constantli exploit drag grave enough enough
