0,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Visuals Top, Movie Not",6,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces?

1,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning and action packed but story is light,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",sequel design look match first film longer impact ocean set bring new creatur us marvel breathtakingli new year ago lot action set piec great watch although feel either repetit borrow previou cameron film like titan bring back grace charact evil colonel felt much one grace sigorney weaver would suffici colonel could easili brother like die hard although would requir addit stori chang regard adolesc spider charact would better whole import famili theme run everyth much well let make sure incident charact die higher frame rate aspect ad noth extra time made feel like video like real film although interestingli video feel alway like hobbit film would come go stori film becom battl jake clone colonel rest global aspect pandora vers human drop waysid would interest new antagonist clone colonel disobey order gener goe awol hunt jake like captain ahab white whale
2,Avatar: The Way of Water,Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.,6,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",jame cameron film impress special effect camerawork world build action chart avatar way water struggl like predecessor stori charact develop depart fact stori way water almost ident first avatar instead human learn na vi fight stephen slang famili forest na vi learn ocean na vi fight stephen lang strength weak first movi back one bonu compar origin realli visual feast special effect masterpiec like first avatar
3,Avatar: The Way of Water,I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one,4,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved.

4,Avatar: The Way of Water,Empty beauty,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",jame cameron bring biggest disappoint year avatar noth empti beauti start hurri introduct plot narrat jake happi dude made kid somehow none explain well appar matter peopl evil reason jake flee beauti water world never hear forest world probabl destroy care genocid former tribe jake son touch whale touch way interest reason human send mile clone jake spend massiv amount money hunt even though object stop jake creat upris alreadi succeed jake lay low hide reason hunt still three hour movi avatar feel rush quit often subplot introduc hint get thrown away without resolv big plot point feel rush get spend half hour watch complet unnecessari whalehunt suppos get attach jake new kid one show depth charact one get bulli punish even father hard feel attach charact shallow husk dialogu absolut horrend rare get deeper come bro gotta bro famili bro overus bro madden bring alreadi terribl dialogu sub zero level none interact feel natur spider charact epitom horribl cast ad absolut noth plot polit ask mile stop kill time charact movi show depth develop whale kid end extrem lacklust new water tribe discard entir big fight water tribe help new friend cool wateri way join jake ride disappear get rehash begin fight five peopl watch past two hour thing alway done charact save fight whale end new waterworld set peopl noth beauti background instead someth actual play plot charact bad avatar look amaz action scene stun water world majest creatur beauti empti beauti substanc might biggest disappoint year movi wise
5,Avatar: The Way of Water,James Cameron's triumphant return,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",hard believ sequel avatar actual come year feel like half dozen delay offici someon surpris much movi held recent view therefor high expect sequel say live hype mayb littl less great sit littl longer could sure first movi long minut long feel length honesti got wrap movi look sound much probabl could gone anoth hour still felt restless one best pace hour movi ever seen could argu even pace littl fast first act thank time skip mean viewer caught speed quickli visual effect wise perfect numer expens blockbust releas everi year given time avatar clearli given look leagu better million plu movi releas last year great someth say often find stun new area pandora explor thank extens underwat scene stori wise say littl less predict first stori seem bother peopl anyth jame cameron might criticis borrow much introduc child charact made think alien termin part action scene avatar look littl familiar anyon seen titan abyss even termin littl corni dialogu coupl slightli clunki scene earli lack definit climax see sequel plan problem bare matter strength movi overwhelm make must watch cinema felt great see blockbust like
6,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is",6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI.

7,Avatar: The Way of Water,Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

8,Avatar: The Way of Water,Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic,6,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding..

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line..

9,Avatar: The Way of Water,"A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche",7,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",love first movi like love movi thin stori basic dialogu simplist outlook life stori yet first one movi beauti stori famili love cameron know pull string hollywood use great clearli cameron one last true director tinseltown complet sold think movi long think simplist worldview shade gray somewhat cring dialogu reduc score much fulli enjoy spectacl howev entertain stun look give lot prop feel movi someth experi get mention initi magic first movi definit still biggest box offic year sure cannot say great movi gave highli recommend especi love first one find movi bit cheesi anyth great felt first one
10,Avatar: The Way of Water,Damn James Cameron...,9,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron.

11,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning but very weak characters and story,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",prefac say huge jame cameron fan titan avatar list top ten movi time icon timeless suspens excit heartwarm cameron establish brand produc epic qualiti movi one howev mediocr unlik movi realli anyth special abyss breakthrough liquid anim titan epic scale love stori avatar revolutionari graphic great stori way water anyth realli stand open minut felt choppi fail creat emot traction sulli new famili motiv charact question also volatil one minut angri someon someth next minut help quaritch burn villag kill na vi dismiss apathet toward spider spider threaten goe soft sudden son even know use violenc especi quaritch complet illog pointless serv noth lame attempt shock audienc e burn metkayina villag person action charact especi children also annoy fail commun explain thing lead constant misunderstand fail listen constantli caus havoc anoth weak attempt depict angst teenag track edit also poor scene feel like stitch togeth one moment see jake famili practic someth enjoy see random scene quaritch back na vi also epic battl final whole movi build like first one avatar see thing start peac rda tri peac resolut school send jake thing slowli escal home tree destroy gradual need war end kid get captur fight move happi fight anoth kidnap final fight whale jake quaritch fist fight everyth feel weak loos wound conclus event steadi buildup tension last thing fair bit recycl dialogu camera angl motif first end exampl sulli say know take stand learn first one went war fight land forget one tri run away throughout movi come back realiz overal memor special movi felt like use stun visual crutch weak stori charact would much excit new villain much formid human mayb would team human fight instead recycl quaritch grace charact like new idea would nice end like dark knight built first movi took whole new level suspens storytel unfortun deliv frankli forgett

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

13,Avatar: The Way of Water,"I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax.",10,"Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.",okay gunna write heart one mainli impact movi call movi entir famili sit imax theatr sound blast visual face via perfectli implement real experi movi realli feel confid exagger say complex well written nuanc stori ever creat movi massiv amount improv write first movi well realli kind movi bunch charact absolut ador end rememb forev outsid ot one particular charact love great deal sigourney nail movi need thing mention amaz experi draw breath lung part lip utter disbelief see time almost feel nope movi need exactli experi almost essenti biggest baddest bell whistl attach theatr screen possibl get cinema experi movi watch home smaller screen stream otherwis say similar first movi think okay mayb opinion movi person sit theatr surround sound imax whatev els watch film come end total unaffect miser person look someth never find last year endur speci hour magic film provid good theatr enough leav entir group entireti audienc sat within huge smile occasion teari eye upon credit roll buzz atmospher walk peopl look amaz seen sinc spider man nwh care say plot stori whatev tri less miser experi mani other ever forget wait next one pleas see cinema late

A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

15,Avatar: The Way of Water,One of the most visually innovative films ever,9,"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",film visual stun simpli seen biggest screen possibl best way enjoy film let consum stori one peopl get behind enhanc visual storytel screen look film detail much happen visual engulf say stori perfect hour runtim help flesh charact give stori depth weight realli get tv seri these day honestli could plot hole realli care look nitpick movi mayb rethink life enjoy one gorgeou piec art world ever produc think much work put amaz feel film got one best cinema experi ever probabl along dunkirk origin avatar releas akira know seen imax mayb would knock film park know probabl gonna see movi time least imax even mean broke one film breathtak
16,Avatar: The Way of Water,How does a script get ignored for 13 years?,4,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

20,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022, James Cameron) Cameron impresses with visuals but story is lacking and treads a lot of the ground the original movie did",6,"'Avatar: The Way of Water' is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 'Avatar', also directed by James Cameron. If this teaches us anything it is that more than likely you shouldn't bet against James Cameron as his high profile sequel soared to $1 billion dollars worldwide in only 14 days and, when all is said and done, will probably be one of only a handful of films to make over $2 billion. Despite a 13 year hiatus all of the principle actors return to reprise their roles including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. The film is a technical marvel and much of the delay was due to the need to actually develop the appropriate technology to allow filming Cameron's meticulous vision. At least one more Avatar film will be produced with the potential for more if they keep being successful.It is 12 years after the events of the first film and Jake Sully is the chief of his clan and lives with his wife Neytiri and their 3 children plus the adopted daughter of Grace's comatose avatar who's conception is a mystery. The daughter, Kiri, is also played by Sigourney Weaver who played Grace in the previous film. Another constant presence is a human boy called Spider who is a child of the deceased Miles Quaritch. The kid was too young to be put in cryostasis at the time most of the humans were expelled, and thus was allowed to stay growing up wild and much more Na'vi than human. Spider is, of course, practically inseparable from Sully's kids so you can see the potential for drama here. The ""Sky People"" as they are called have returned with the aim now being to colonize rather than plunder as the Earth is dying. The Sky People once again return with avatars of their own but this time instead of transferring a live human's consciousness into the avatar they were able to upload the thoughts and memories of deceased soldiers including the major antagonist from the first film Quaritch who serves as this avatar contingent's leader. On a raid Quaritch's avatars manage to capture Jake's kids including Spider. All of the kids are liberated except Spider who ends up begrudgingly aiding Quaritch. There is some sort of father son bonding that does occur, however, Spider remains predominantly loyal to his adopted Na'vi family. Jake Sully decides the best thing for the tribe is for him to take his family and flee. They eventually land with the reef people and need to learn the way of water to live there and be of use. There are growing pains for the family as they attempt to learn the ways of the new tribe. The children especially struggle as they don't fit in with the other kids. Of course Quaritch does not just let Sully and his family run and eventually tracks them to the reef people and begins a shock and awe campaign of violence to flush them out. The kids get captured again, and eventually a big showdown occurs, and of course with Cameron it is a spectacle of a showdown and while the side of right prevails, as one would expect, they do clearly leave room for the story to continue on.Cameron has clearly created a sumptuous visual feast with motion capture technology at the most cutting edge that it has every been, and I don't want to undersell the special effects as those special effects are why people are tuning in. It is why people are spending top dollar on premium seats at the best screens they can find because, story aside, this film demands to be seen in that format. Much like the first film 'The Way of Water' feels like all of the creative effort was put into the technical aspect of the film and the story is, for the most part, basic. In fact there are many very similar themes to the first story. As Jake initially needed to gain the trust of the forest people and bond with their mounts the family goes through the exact same trials when they get to the reef people. This film actually may take a step backwards with the plot due to some gaping plot holes that they just plow through with all their fancy effects hoping nobody is paying too close attention to things like the narrative. It is an incredibly bizarre shift that in the first film the human invaders were looking for the universe's most expensive mineral, and only 12 years later the Earth is dying so now finding a new home is the mission du jour. Somewhere in there they just managed to uncover a completely different substance that everybody is after, and there is no mention of the unobtanium that drove the entire plot of the first film. The other huge flaw is the main driver for this film which is Quaritch's pursuit of Jake Sully which seems very much like a vendetta from his past life although it is not framed that way. The story only casually mentions why so many resources are being exhausted to hunt down this former chieftain. The script does not make it clear whether or not the Sky People seek to inhabit Pandora along with the Na'vi or if the are seeking to destroy them or pacify them. I think ultimately the aim, for now, is pacification and they believe getting Jake Sully will somehow accomplish that although once his family goes into exile that makes zero sense. It is super frustrating to see such an impressive display and see the narrative squandered. I will give James Cameron all the credit in the world as he has made a movie that everyone believes needs to be seen in theaters on the big screen, and I agree with that sentiment. Due to the visual effects alone this is a special film, however, these films of his are never going to be great until he can really develop the narrative beyond these basic confines he has lain out while also making the story actually make sense with in the larger framework of the film. As with the first movie 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is a beautiful yet flawed ideal.Eric's Grade: B-",avatar way water long gestat sequel mammoth hit avatar also direct jame cameron teach us anyth like bet jame cameron high profil sequel soar billion dollar worldwid day said done probabl one hand film make billion despit year hiatu principl actor return repris role includ sam worthington zoe saldana stephen lang sigourney weaver film technic marvel much delay due need actual develop appropri technolog allow film cameron meticul vision least one avatar film produc potenti keep success year event first film jake sulli chief clan live wife neytiri children plu adopt daughter grace comatos avatar concept mysteri daughter kiri also play sigourney weaver play grace previou film anoth constant presenc human boy call spider child deceas mile quaritch kid young put cryostasi time human expel thu allow stay grow wild much na vi human spider cours practic insepar sulli kid see potenti drama sky peopl call return aim colon rather plunder earth die sky peopl return avatar time instead transfer live human conscious avatar abl upload thought memori deceas soldier includ major antagonist first film quaritch serv avatar conting leader raid quaritch avatar manag captur jake kid includ spider kid liber except spider end begrudgingli aid quaritch sort father son bond occur howev spider remain predominantli loyal adopt na vi famili jake sulli decid best thing tribe take famili flee eventu land reef peopl need learn way water live use grow pain famili attempt learn way new tribe children especi struggl fit kid cours quaritch let sulli famili run eventu track reef peopl begin shock awe campaign violenc flush kid get captur eventu big showdown occur cours cameron spectacl showdown side right prevail one would expect clearli leav room stori continu cameron clearli creat sumptuou visual feast motion captur technolog cut edg everi want undersel special effect special effect peopl tune peopl spend top dollar premium seat best screen find stori asid film demand seen format much like first film way water feel like creativ effort put technic aspect film stori part basic fact mani similar theme first stori jake initi need gain trust forest peopl bond mount famili goe exact trial get reef peopl film actual may take step backward plot due gape plot hole plow fanci effect hope nobodi pay close attent thing like narr incred bizarr shift first film human invad look univers expens miner year later earth die find new home mission du jour somewher manag uncov complet differ substanc everybodi mention unobtanium drove entir plot first film huge flaw main driver film quaritch pursuit jake sulli seem much like vendetta past life although frame way stori casual mention mani resourc exhaust hunt former chieftain script make clear whether sky peopl seek inhabit pandora along na vi seek destroy pacifi think ultim aim pacif believ get jake sulli somehow accomplish although famili goe exil make zero sens super frustrat see impress display see narr squander give jame cameron credit world made movi everyon believ need seen theater big screen agre sentiment due visual effect alon special film howev film never go great realli develop narr beyond basic confin lain also make stori actual make sens larger framework film first movi avatar way water beauti yet flaw ideal eric grade b
21,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Empty, loveless and lazy writing.",1,"Well, that was.. something. Yes, like everybody else I agree: the visuals were stunning. That's why it's getting 1 star.I wasn't expecting anything from the story seeing as the story in the first movie was average but fun to watch. So I went in blind. It really felt like a next-gen video game and if it were a game I would've liked it more - I think. But for me it was just awful.Let me put it this way, if you are able to ignore the macho sexism and every tired trope, then you'll probably have fun. I couldn't. It was too much, too cliché, too cheesy, too stupid.Regarding the tired tropes, we have for example,the ""sweet little daughter who gets caught every time""""the weird ""freak"" who is strangely attuned to the nature and gets to show it off at the end""""the outcast who befriends another outcast and both get to redeem themselves""""the bullies picking on the new kids but hey, new kid saves them, so they're besties now""""The distant, stern father who is too tough to show his love for his kids in a healthy way""and so ond, and so forth. But the thing is, I didn't care for any of the characters because it simply felt empty. I didn't root for anyone and what the hell was up with their marriage?? No chemistry, no love?It also felt like the qriters didn't know what message they wanted to send, should it be a movie against whaling? Against genocide of indigenous people? About friendship? Nobody knows.And lastly, do the women actually have any dialogue except for grunting, screaming and looking like psychopaths? Honestly, it felt like they had maybe like 5 sentences or something.

22,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun",5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make.

23,Avatar: The Way of Water,Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(,5,"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding.

24,Avatar: The Way of Water,"More Avatar, More Water, More Average",6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.",jame cameron give jame bond thunderbal competit mani underwat sequenc fit featur length three hour film movi alright guess retread quit bit first film feel like style substanc place pretti shot cgi get emot impact one much origin jake neytiri get way less screentim focus children secondari charact blue peopl action sure justifi runtim think could easili cut minut without problem score decent although jame horner absenc notic want avatar deliv guess expect anyth new stori littl underwhelm think
25,The Menu,"A completely bonkers and over-the-top, yet perhaps brilliant satire",8,"This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.I won't spoil anything with a synopsis, but rather try to intrigue anyone on the fence about seeing this movie.The Menu has something fresh and interesting to say about the tired conversation surrounding the marriage between art and artist. There are some very clearly illogical and confusing elements of the plot that you can easily miss if you're taking it at face value.Overall, this movie isn't meant to be a sensible, coherent and satisfying thriller. Instead, it's a comment on a poignant phenomenon in our society: the way we view, consume, pursue, and ultimately obsess over those who produce the art around us. Sure, the movie is about a chef and his meticulous menu, but in reality the larger point is about the production of any type of art, namely filmmaking.It seems to me that the filmmaker is making a very focused point about the state of movies nowadays. There seems to be a constant theme throughout about how often artist and their fans seem so detached from each other, even though their mutual approval of the art should be enough to bring them together.An absolutely bonkers second act and a considerably more bonkers third act wrap up what I believe to be a masterpiece commentary on the state of filmmaking in 2022. The only moneymakers are massive superhero movies, massive studio A++ list celebrity movies, etc, and the makers of this film ask one simple question:How long until we collectively call out their BS and ask for some simple bread?The movie makes you question how far you'd go into ""buying into the hype"", and conversely has a quite shocking commentary on those who consistently stay away from ""the hype"" without buying into it. Think of some of the ridiculous fashion trends that some of the highest brands in clothing perpetuate, and just how many people will blindly follow simply because there is an LV or GG stamp on it.It's no shock to me that a script with this kind of tonal shifting comes to us from the writers/directors of Succession. So much of the way this film is crafted reminds me of the show. Sharp wit, sarcasm that lies somewhere between funny and cringeworthy, twists, turns, and of course, the oh-so subtle thumbing of the nose at all the socially accepted, yet fundamentally insane reverence for brilliance that we hold dear.As a movie-lover, this was one of the more thought provoking pieces of the year. This movie makes you wonder what the line is between brilliant artist and insane psycho. The movie makes you look around and find yourself in the all the characters; the artist, the art, and those who are (literally) consuming it.All in all, this movie is an insightful parody of the state of not only the word of fine dining, but also fashion, art, filmmaking, music, etc. I might have a completely wrong reading of this movie, but hey, that's what art's about, right?",movi play someth everyon come across live obsess movi start seemingli eeri thriller suspens type movi weird uniqu quirk slowli devolv someth much wild obvious take far script tighter meticul craft chef menu even curmudgeon movi goer plate full one spoil anyth synopsi rather tri intrigu anyon fenc see movi menu someth fresh interest say tire convers surround marriag art artist clearli illog confus element plot easili miss take face valu overal movi meant sensibl coher satisfi thriller instead comment poignant phenomenon societi way view consum pursu ultim obsess produc art around us sure movi chef meticul menu realiti larger point product type art name filmmak seem filmmak make focus point state movi nowaday seem constant theme throughout often artist fan seem detach even though mutual approv art enough bring togeth absolut bonker second act consider bonker third act wrap believ masterpiec commentari state filmmak moneymak massiv superhero movi massiv studio list celebr movi etc maker film ask one simpl question long collect call bs ask simpl bread movi make question far go buy hype convers quit shock commentari consist stay away hype without buy think ridicul fashion trend highest brand cloth perpetu mani peopl blindli follow simpli lv gg stamp shock script kind tonal shift come us writer director success much way film craft remind show sharp wit sarcasm lie somewher funni cringeworthi twist turn cours oh subtl thumb nose social accept yet fundament insan rever brillianc hold dear movi lover one thought provok piec year movi make wonder line brilliant artist insan psycho movi make look around find charact artist art liter consum movi insight parodi state word fine dine also fashion art filmmak music etc might complet wrong read movi hey art right
26,The Menu,The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.,5,"The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation.

27,The Menu,One of the most unique theater going experiences I've had in a long time,8,"This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.What set this film apart from other thriller, horrors are great performances and great writing. Every character here is well done and intelligently written. The entire cast gives great performances with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy truly being the standouts as they playoff each other very well.Each character purposely reflected a personality type that if you ever worked in service you would encounter and come to know very well. To my fellow service employees you know what I'm talking about.What really stuck with me long after the credits have rolled is the commentary this film has on society. At it's core I believe this film to be about a Chef who's long career facing multitudes of people both customers and critics has affected his passion for his art. It's here where I also believe to be the film makers commentary on what it is to be an artist in this films case a Chef. It felt to me what the film makers are saying is as artists they pour their heart and souls into their art and craft both to serve and entertain us and as consumers it's very easy to lose appreciation for that hard work and effort.But I digress, perhaps I'm over thinking things and this film is not very deep as I seem to believe it is. Nonetheless this film was quite unique, thrilling, and entertaining. It's films like these that remind me of why I go to the theater and why I fell in love with storytelling and cinema.IMDb: 8/10

28,The Menu,A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today,10,"From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger. As the chef pointed out, they didn't try hard enough to fight back. It was as if they all had already accepted the menu. In the final scene, you can see some of them even thanking chef.Though some of them tried to escape, they didn't fight back. Margot fought back, against the menu, by sending it back and being authentic with herself and then with the chef.",start trailer think mani realiz typic film mean cannot watch stori narr understand represent satir satir premis film lose passion purpos chef suicid tendenc plot film lose purpos joy desir fulfil purpos reflect also convers margot also felt way work actor chef call actor lost purpos end margot call said chef one purpos purpos creat food custom might enjoy fail whole premis whole point film chef fail societi tendenc pressur pleas tri pleas imposs end lose purpos joy desir chef invit peopl blame ruin art life end straight point margot someth chef wait told authent truth everyon afraid afraid chef afraid offend margot never like food start want send back stop tyler end face death stood told chef truth like food courag send back chef ask want eat rememb photo saw room one time chef ever smile back start greasi teen back knew joy purpos chef serv food custom pleas statu quo remind rememb said toward end pain almost gone almost took away pain remind joy cook sum point movi restaur america becom today becom nation bent pleas unpleas peopl longer own nation like chef own instead wealthi angel investor like chef includ rest staff joy soul purpos nation erod away cheeseburg repres heart america use like chef cook cheeseburg rememb joy purpos american rememb margot specif ask american chees chef comment best chees melt without split chees constitut bind us togeth american would split chees make cheeseburg chees burger peopl restaur repres variou aspect nation young men young gener ambiti go getter focus work money quit clearli express dialog old coupl repres old polit gener taken everyth grant server ask handl right left also notic husband old white male specif case skinni blond wife shoulder length hair dress old fashion server chose left hand chef mock donkey final clue margot reveal chef rattl pretti direct clue specif satir movi star assist repres wash name drop hollywood chef said lost purpos critic editor repres media review give rise downfal restaur chef said mani live ruin coast guard feder agent like fbi cia etc yet part kitchen tyler know young colleg gener think know everyth work head knowledg life experi polit talk think run countri better realli put test fail like tyler kitchen dish call bs margot chef said work class servic provid nonsens peopl want cheeseburg rememb said imagin restaur actual design serv actual food bread scene version emperor new cloth everyon knew bread play along groupthink pretend actual dish margot one buy call food young men acknowledg dish want special treatment one bread use name posit tri get bread end margot establish server custom relationship realiz along st moment chef talk chef look rememb want send food back also remind tyler pay serv chef misplac one server context scene server custom last scene pivot outright said eater led revel stand custom return menu ask cheeseburg chef allow leav want go custom alway right remind constitut republ politician work us peopl like margot need establish fix relationship order nation surviv otherwis like everyon els restaur knew go die littl prevent demis simpli part menu chef actual brought point coast guard came even margot got could thing ask cheeseburg chef point tri hard enough fight back alreadi accept menu final scene see even thank chef though tri escap fight back margot fought back menu send back authent chef
29,The Menu,"Nice Try, But the Satire Doesn't Land",6,"Nice try, but the satire doesn't land in this film that skewers pretentious foodies and the chefs who cook for them.There's already been one satire this year that savages the rich, ""Triangle of Sadness,"" and that's a much better film than this one. I'm ok with an outlandish premise, but if you're going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they're in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next. The tone doesn't stick to one or the other, so what was probably intended to be cutting instead falls flat.The ending especially is silly.

The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution of the Movie.Things I Did Like -1. The First Half Was Really Good, Nice Chilled out Mellow Mood with a Hint of Something Sinister Going on was Weaved Within the First Half.2. The Description and Pictures of the Different Dishes on screen was Great to See.3. The Anya Taylor Joy Character Reveal whilst talking to the Chef was Ok I guess.4. The Cop or Security Guy that Shows Up to Help was a Good Scene.5. I liked the Fact that the Chef Knew Exactly who everyone was and their History. Also, in the first half, he had this Charming yet Mysterious Malicious Vibe about him. That was Excellent.Problems I Have with the Movie -1. I get the Motivation for why the Chef is Doing what he is Doing to these People but it wasn't Executed with any Interest in these Characters.2. After the First Half, the Mood changed because the Characters Sort of Knew where this was heading and I didn't like that tone whatsoever, it was kind of like seriousness with a joky overtone and it didn't work for me.3. Two People do Something to themselves because of the there own Self-Disappointment and Supposed Admiration for the Chef and I thought to myself ""Really?""4. There is a pointless albeit a sort of funny to watch ""Activity"" that happens in the Movie. But it was Pointless.5. At the End, When Anya Taylor Joy gives the Chef a ""Change of Heart"", I thought it was a great idea however once again, it wasn't Executed profoundly, it was Dull.6. The Final, Final end Bit, some of the Characters actually start Believing what this Chef is saying and agreeing with him, ""Like Really?""Overall, The Premise was Far Better than the Execution.",folk need know premis better actual execut movi thing like first half realli good nice chill mellow mood hint someth sinist go weav within first half descript pictur differ dish screen great see anya taylor joy charact reveal whilst talk chef ok guess cop secur guy show help good scene like fact chef knew exactli everyon histori also first half charm yet mysteri malici vibe excel problem movi get motiv chef peopl execut interest charact first half mood chang charact sort knew head like tone whatsoev kind like serious joki overton work two peopl someth self disappoint suppos admir chef thought realli pointless albeit sort funni watch activ happen movi pointless end anya taylor joy give chef chang heart thought great idea howev execut profoundli dull final final end bit charact actual start believ chef say agre like realli overal premis far better execut
31,The Menu,I tried to chew but couldn't swallow,6,"""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end.

32,The Menu,86 it!,4,This looked like an interesting film based on the trailer and the first half of it was just that. The tension and suspense was building nicely. There were little dribs and drabs and hints of what might be coming without being too obvious. The acting from everyone in the film was good. Even supporting characters with only a few lines. Were well realized I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to see where it was all going.Sadly it didn't really go anywhere. It all unwound in the second half. The acting was still on but the writing failed. That's the most i can say without giving up any spoilers. And that was extra disappointing because the first half was so good.

There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.While the plot is pretty original (which normally scores high points with me) and while the film is at times quite beautiful to look at, it altogether missed the main point of a good meal: gratification.Scares are not included on the menu; comedic value is barely there; it is unsatisfyingly light on gore; hints of interesting dialogue exist, but they are scantily peppered throughout; the characters as well as their backstories, are as distinctly unpalatable, as are their intentions nondescript; it wore on and became progressively less, instead of more enjoyable; and the main course was both 'cheesy' and less than fulfilling.

Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect audience surrogate amongst a sea of deliberately unlikeable characters of which the best is Nicholas Hoult whose almost too good at making his character hilariously pathetic.Mark Mylod's direction is excellent, the film has more than enough visual style to match the pretentiousness of its characters and is really good at building tension.

It will have you laughing while on the edge of your seat as it navigates you through a restaurant experience to remember.We are treated to a fantastic ensemble cast. Nicholas Hoult steals the show with a pitch perfect performance of a pretentious foodie. Fiennes is so wonderfully unhinged as the mysterious creator of the eponymous menu in a very layered role. Anya Taylor Joy as always is so watchable, providing such an easy way in for the audience. The writing gives them all such brilliant material which the whole cast executes with ease.The style and staging of the piece can't be faulted at all. It is precise, inventive, and so clean and polished which makes for a very visually appealing film.It must be said there are a few rough edges when it comes to the plot, and when you get down to the nuts and bolts the premise isn't necessarily groundbreaking. It is very on the nose at times and subtlety isn't exactly it's strong suit.

37,The Menu,"Serve me something else, please.",3,"'The Menu' received widespread acclaim, and honestly I can't fathom why. The film is just as pretentious as gourmet cooking.So, twelve guests attend an executive, very, very expensive dinner on an island. All of them were personally invited by Chef Slowik. On arrival, the maître d'hôtel Elsa noticed Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) did not bring his original date. With him is Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) who - as it turns out - was hired to accompany him. This little detail will play a big part later.The rest of the film is set almost entirely in the restaurant, as we watch the specially selected menu being served - gourmet cooking at its best. Exquisite dishes are being served, impeccably garnished to perfection. (Personally, I've never been one for gourmet food. I want FOOD, not samples thereof...)We soon realize there is something sinister about the chef. This is one of those films where saying too much will result in spoilers. All I'm going to say, is that even after a person gets killed in view of everyone, they continue serving and the guest continue to saviour their food. And even towards the end they STILL have an appetite and comment on how delicious the food is - after everything that's happened...!!!! I shook my head in disbelief thinking ""what the bloody hell is wrong with these people..."".As the film developed, it became weirder and weirder. Just weird. There were a few character twists, but as a whole the movie just wasn't entertaining. Oh, and the Tyler character was a real idiot and the most unlikeable character. Very little to nothing is told why the victims deserved their fate. This film made absolutely no sense whatsoever.Despite all the fancy trimmings, by the end all I wanted was a plain ole cheese burger (figuratively speaking, off course). I wanted something with substance, and not merely hints of something promising (hmm, just like gourmet food...)Had 'The Menu' not been given a substantial budget with a stellar cast, this could easily have ended up being a bad B-movie. By the time the film ended, it felt like a complete waste of time for this highly overrated film. 'The Menu' did not satisfy my palette. I can't recommend this.Would I watch it again? No!

39,The Menu,Absence Of A Single Likable Character (Or Over-Arching Message) May Limit The Palette Here,3,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining"" is anything but.To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu"" was that it lacked any character I could really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I couldn't find a ""way in"".I also believe that ""The Menu"" is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to see what sticks"" sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.I can give ""The Menu"" 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly care one way or another.",mark mylod menu clearli satir great mani thing class snobbish obsess eat experi gener immedi spring mind certainli get awkward laugh throw enough bizarr sight charact gag live satir monik without one coher arc messag singl charact realli root basic overview menu follow tyler nichola hoult margot anya taylor joy embark lavish expens dine experi coordin master chef slowik ralph fienn cours progress weird quickli becom deadli seriou pop up becom appar fine dine anyth glare problem menu lack charact could realli root amidst bizarr natur circumst place certainli chef pretenti passeng clearli protagonist suppos taylor joy margot even charact difficult root begin suffer themat irregular reveal difficult becom invest film find way also believ menu much throw bunch theme wall see stick sort movi number undercurr run pictur larg dangl front audienc quickli move next one overal take home messag thoroughfar found give menu star least compet product visual tonal standpoint even one accept spatter idea constitut plot may difficult find someth someon make truli care one way anoth
40,The Menu,A sumptuous feast for the eyes,9,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is a tasteful treat that manages to be gripping, satirical, jarring, and hauntingly brilliant. The film is a great social commentary on class values and class systems. It gives audiences an adrenaline rush that makes for an exciting and wild viewing experience. The film is filled with twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing till the credits roll. Apart from its rich screenplay and magnificent production design, the film also benefits from having a star-studded cast. Ralph Fiennes as the stern and conservative Chef Slovik is the obvious standout, but Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot aka Erin brings something different to the table (literally). Nicholas Hoult as Tyler perfectly brings this rather douchey and self-obsessed character to life. I went in completely blind, not having watched the trailer and avoided any marketing for the movie, and I'm glad that I did. Everyone should experience this movie by themselves and to not let anyone influence their opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie nabs Oscar nominations for best production design and best screenplay.

41,The Menu,I'd Like To Take It Back,4,"So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.The film sees a young couple who travel to a Remote Island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the Chef has prepared a lavish & interesting menu. Though as soon as they arrive there, things are not all they seem & the food the Chef brings out makes the couple & everyone else question what is really going on as a sinister feeling starts to boil...!I found the film to be not the greatest. I mean, the first half is great & suspenseful & really keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It really entices you in as there doesn't appear to be anything to make you think something obviously bad is going to happen. So, for the first half it's great, but...The second half is a let down. The film goes completely off the rails, the story itself & its narrative are as clear as mud & there's so many unanswered questions, plot holes & things that happen that go against the main antagonists rules. The ending was just bad also & just plain lazy & too straight forward for a film like this one.The action we did get, the gore & shocking violence were great, but couldn't save this dish, sadly. There's some humour to be had in this film which was good, but again, couldn't salvage this feast even if it wanted to.The film does somewhat drag & the runtime is 100 minutes too long (1 hour & 40 minutes). I also felt the narrative & story arc of the film wasn't clear enough & the ending was totally unsatisfactory. The cast, however, were great. The characters were ok, but the main female lead was pretty unlikable. Chef Slowik was good though.Overall, it's a pretty out there film. Not the greatest & has a clear as mud plot with other elements not aiding in the understanding. The characters are ok, but weak with the except of Chef Slowik, the main antagonist Margo wasn't likable & pretty obnoxious. The films story arc & ending made no sense & had 0 explanation by the final act with a dragged out pacing & runtime. While there was some funny parts & some action/gore, it couldn't save this dish that I would like to take back.4/10.",seen brief preview read briefli entir sure expect horror comedi type film reason went see film see young coupl travel remot island eat exclus restaur chef prepar lavish interest menu though soon arriv thing seem food chef bring make coupl everyon els question realli go sinist feel start boil found film greatest mean first half great suspens realli keep guess go happen next realli entic appear anyth make think someth obvious bad go happen first half great second half let film goe complet rail stori narr clear mud mani unansw question plot hole thing happen go main antagonist rule end bad also plain lazi straight forward film like one action get gore shock violenc great save dish sadli humour film good salvag feast even want film somewhat drag runtim minut long hour minut also felt narr stori arc film clear enough end total unsatisfactori cast howev great charact ok main femal lead pretti unlik chef slowik good though overal pretti film greatest clear mud plot element aid understand charact ok weak except chef slowik main antagonist margo likabl pretti obnoxi film stori arc end made sens explan final act drag pace runtim funni part action gore save dish would like take back

I was completely enchanted. The cinematography and acting is stunning. But somewhere in the middle something went very wrong. So wrong that you don't understand what's going on. And that's exactly where The Menu fails. Too many awkward and crazy things happen and no one seemed to care, and that's also when I realized that The Menu is actually a very pointless and empty dark satire with no real punchline.

48,The Menu,6' Deep Plot Holes,1,"Felt like the script was banged out over a weekend with plot holes big enough to drive a freight train through. Zero character development; the players were flatter than a tortilla with a printed picture. The further along we went, the more kludged the story line; I ran out of disbelief to suspend. People simply don't do the things the characters pretended to do. The drowning angel segment was like a wart on the production. This was a circus of emotional manipulation. I guess the moral of the story was - the ho' is proletariat, the ho' gets to live.The fake Coast Guard guy was predictable from a mile away, just another of a series of disjointed and manipulative plot subdivisions. Knowing they were all slated to die, not one of them concluded that going berserk on the staff might have been a saving strategy, reinforcing the people-are-sheep canard. The chef's mother may as well have been a cardboard cutout. Far more could have been done with the cult aspect of the boot camp servility of the staff. As it was, this critique of chef worship was toothless. The revenge theme barely saw daylight through a mishmash of gratuitous segments. What was the deal on pretending to let the men escape?

49,Babylon,Excess is the name of the game,8,"Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood.",whether orgi showcas variou bodili fluid plot thread runtim film damien chazel fulli unrestrain latest film la la land whiplash favorit film big fan chazel directori style show flash brillianc often throughout babylon indulg extrem tendenc well modern hollywood epic lot like open sequenc sight behold mesmer vibrant energi film chug along good pace next two hour point realli feel runtim last hour chazel lose stori bit sever instanc thought film anoth scene would pop next runtim realli feel unnecessari honestli whole plot line could cut affect film justin hurwitz compos anoth terrif score nice hint la la land photographi costum product design stellar outsid shoddi edit especi bizarr movi montag end realli gel technic aspect film quit achiev chazel realli need someon tell film better edit combin self restraint would much closer epic masterpiec statu clearli aim stand pretti entertain tale excess fame earli year hollywood
50,Babylon,Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse,8,"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out.",interest open scene main charact manni diego calva tri get eleph parti bel air babylon floor ga pedal bare come air rest run time want credit damien chazel team provid uniqu experi regard pace set tone express fever dream overus babylon captur chaotic constantli shift way kept enraptur movi look fantast even interest period cinema doubt babylon still pull costum set dynam show disorgan tumultu earli hollywood hook get go movi flaw present vibrant fast move keep help entertain babylon distinct look pace come charact thing littl familiar conrad laroy loos base coupl peopl era lesson movi want teach us hollywood chew spit talent pretti routin think babylon effect get across littl let movi start bombast quietli tip toe convention end charact meant less distinct manni audienc avatar exampl wish littl fresh want follow throughout length movi damien chazel enough name could probabl get actor actress want cast still attract big interest name babylon think everi member main cast fantast job credit chazel get perform brad pitt biggest name realli enjoy work put jack conrad appropri funni conrad lush top behaviour garner genuin sympathi world turn pitt could play big came entitl prick warmth passion conrad pitt get across alway like margot robbi point nelli throw complet surpris amount physic nuanc nelli whirlwind behaviour much like pitt realli funni given opportun despit pretti telegraph arc charact understand manni resist nelli even crystal clear bad news wrap pretti packag would hope pitt robbi get award consider work diego repres audienc wit crazi go along pretti blank slate enough diego charact distinct understand motiv want credit li jun li jovan adepo ladi fay zhu sidney palmer respect charact written heavi hand sympathet respect moment oddest cast tobey maguir threaten mobster jame mckay maguir surprisingli good creepi underworld figur get neg babylon movi indulg exact vice lambast film babylon determin show excess hedon era glori appreci moment movi get pretti gross earli scene involv eleph go shock peopl get chazel team tri show realli necessari argu babylon lengthi run time also go drive peopl away also affect stori twist turn charact start depth gradual turn gener nelli specif come mind could easili trim fat movi total length babylon feel littl self indulg previous mention frenet pace keep guess sap end impact got movi tri say wrap deni bounc seat anticip get leav like lavish insan parti babylon present choos take hit whatev poison choic dive headfirst indulg slip back babylon go incred polar film enjoy larg part movi also mani scene fell flat grade babylon somewher round moment babylon real cinemat magic comfort wholesal recommend babylon interest wolf wall street style comedi excess hollywood get pretti dark check
51,Babylon,"Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!",4,"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.",main takeaway left theater even watch film far long probabl one storylin mani make movi fli instead first act drag drag drag funni thing best moment film within first hour less cohes chaotic film excit felt point though film fall apart plotlin stray film mayb crazi energi first third attempt tri regain energi final quit captur came turn debaucheri horror gel well felt like tone contradict began act hand fantast robbi pitt electr way diego calva emot without say anyth brilliant wish script direct la la land writer director damien chazel good act sometim film felt like watch four film time plotlin could movi see jumbl togeth felt self indulg exhaust end one storylin sort end make feel justifi tell afterward credit start roll sat feel wit littl three hour overal recommend peopl mind three hour runtim keep mind film plot goe absolut nowher although might fun trip time rather pointless one talk pictur
52,Babylon,I'm with the elephant!,3,"In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.Writer/director Damien Chazelle, who gave us LA LA LAND a few years ago, turns the clock back to the 1920s when ""Hollywoodland"" was transitioning from silent pictures to sound. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie play two leading actors who flounder during this period of adjustment, cast in a series of tawdry flops. Diego Calva and Jovan Adepo play a Mexican production assistant and a jazz trumpeter whose careers briefly flare. All four stars make the best of their roles despite the chaotic screenplay. Robbie's damaged character, a stock favorite, fueled by addiction to cocaine and gambling, is overdone and risks losing the viewer's sympathy.Orgiastic parties and a weird scene in a mountain torture palace presided over by Tobey Maguire in overdrive bring echoes of historic Babylon and some of the weirder extremes of early Hollywood. And there are many references to SINGING IN THE RAIN, that gem of a film set in the same era as this mash-up - one of the all-time greatest movies.

55,Babylon,Margot is all in!,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.Writer-director Damien Chazelle (Oscar winner, LA LA LAND, 2016) sets the stage for his wild and frenzied epic meant (I think) as a tribute to early Hollywood and the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies. Of course, that topic has been handled in other prestige films - recently with THE ARTIST (2011), as well as the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952). It's the latter which serves as a template or guidepost for Chazelle, to such an extent that he shows clips from it, quotes it, and even has a couple of his characters share similarities with Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood.From the moment she crashes onto the party scene, this becomes Margot Robbie's movie. Fully engaged doesn't begin to describe how she embodies the Nellie LaRoy character. Nellie is a displaced Jersey girl desperate to break into showbiz, and she pursues stardom with everything she has to offer. Nellie is a risk-taker and literal gambler, and the character is supposedly inspired by the infamous Clara Bow. It's at that first wild party where she meets both Jack Conrad (Oscar winner Brad Pitt) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva). Conrad is a huge silent movie star, and also a boozing womanizer with the accompanying swagger (supposedly based on actor John Gilbert). Manny, though a much quieter soul, is much like Nellie in that his ambition is to work in the movie business. The two discuss their dreams while tearing into mounds of cocaine.Nellie's fearlessness in front of the camera (much like Ms. Robbie's) pays off as the offers roll in and she makes her name. She and Manny periodically cross paths as he climbs the ladder towards studio executive. We also keep up with Jack Conrad and his stream of wives, and how things begin to change with THE JAZZ SINGER and the advent of talking motion pictures. While all this is happening, the film also (sorta) follows the career of jazz trumpeter Sidney Powell (Jovan Adepo) as he builds a career as a black performer on screen. One of the more interesting characters who we wish had more screen time is Lady Fay (played by Li Jun Li). We are rarely treated to a Chinese lesbian chanteuse, and she makes each of her scenes quite fascinating.Others in the cast include Olivia Wilde as one of Jack Conrad's many wives, Lukas Haas as an industry guy, Eric Roberts as Nellie's hustler dad, Pat Skipper as William Randolph Hearst, and Max Minghella as the legendary Irving Thalberg. They are each fine, but none as memorable as Tobey Maguire (also a producer on the film), who has a funny/creepy cameo as a fictional giggling gangster named James McKay. However, it's Jean Smart as Elinor St John, a gossip columnist in the mold of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who has the film's best scene when she deals the hard truth to Jack Conrad. Ms. Smart seems to excel in every role she takes these days, and this may be one of her best, albeit with limited screen time.The issues with the film have nothing to do with its entertainment value and outrageous moments or with the performances. Each of those things keep us watching. It's only when we stop and think about it when the problems come into focus. Most blatant is the love story between Manny and Nellie. They actually spend very little time together after their cocaine feast. Certainly not enough to fall in love. There is a 'blackface' scene unlike anything you've seen before, and in 3 hours and 8 minutes director Chazelle follows up the projectile elephant poop with vomit from a drug overdose, vomit from something other than a drug overdose, a urine stream, and rattlesnake venom. At times it seems like he wanted to see just how much he could get away with.Chazelle collaborators from LA LA LAND include cinematographer Linus Sandgren composer Justin Hurwitz, and Film Editor Tom Cross, all three are Oscar winners from that film, and all provide superb work here. The technical aspects of the film are terrific, it's as a story (or stories) where things unravel. It's simply bloated and overly ambitious, while having some of the frenetic pacing of Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE! Or THE GREAT GATSBY. It appears filmmaker Chazelle is attempting to reinforce cinema is art as a spectacle, when most of us don't require more proof. The movie montage at the end is fun to watch, but strikes this viewer as a bit indulgent after a long movie.

56,Babylon,"A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema",8,"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10.",babylon track career manni torr aspir filmmak mexico cross path fellow aspir starlet nelli laroy bacchanalian parti one night lo angel film also follow sever charact parti includ movi star jack conrad cabaret perform fay zhu tabloid journalist elinor st john musician sidney palmer rise fall respect career span end silent film begin sound product charact cross path throughout navig shift busi hollywood larg scale epic damien chazel word ambiti scope mere technic open utterli ravish debaucher parti sequenc captur madden spirit roar twenti hollywood set visual bar fairli high number fantast sequenc throughout film key parti sequenc charact introduc first interven without doubt highlight film charact fiction screenplay blend pass name real life histor hollywood figur well thinli veil refer other firstli almost goe without say babylon gorgeous photograph perform also uniformli solid diego calva likabl presenc centerpiec charact margot robbi portray brash troubl jersey girl fli seat pant comic poignant turn brad pitt fittingli play drunken goodheart movi star jean smart also welcom presenc curt astut gossip columnist ostens base louella parson writer ilk film conscious top mani point captur madcap spirit someth late ken russel would direct first three quarter particularli outstand demonstr realiti technic transit silent film motion pictur talki pose legitim career alter often career destroy challeng nearli everyon part busi chazel project theme audienc one memor protract sequenc robbi charact along sound man struggl fail interrupt struggl perform simpl one page scene nut bolt logist challeng fledgl industri perhap intrigu compon stori highlight vastli differ arduou process make sound pictur actor filmmak accustom establish way time reach final act howev viewer get sens project begin implod weight degre focu certain charact ebb flow film begin lose steam reviv somewhat insan sequenc torr anoth crew member film studio attempt save laroy reckless gambl decis cross path eccentr crime boss play tobey maguir journey subterranean gather place citi debaucher denizen liter gone underground follow reserv moral code garish ghoulish sequenc feel like tour dant inferno probabl quit intent almost madcap open parti sequenc film grind somewhat abrupt halt charact live career face signific devast last thirti minut sens tragedi one might expect feel strang absent perhap charact larger life even cartoonish time still felt emot core miss stori resolv film end profoundli cynic note show hollywood place metaphor devour constantli replenish unend stream make pilgrimag seek etch mark tapestri cinema observ astut implic splash across screen centuri span montag snippet earliest film contemporari one babylon mani strong point mainli visual sturdi perform focu industri realiti earli filmmak st centuri viewer would take grant eventu grow bit long tooth third hour lose tenac enough film entir collaps though come close noth els earn keep ambiti scabrou love hate letter cinema
57,Babylon,Ambitious film torpedoed by weak and self-indulgent script,3,"As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, CA 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer=director Damien Chazelle. Let me admit up front that I absolutely LOVED all three of his prior movies (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", and ""First Man""). Hence I went into this film with high expectations. Alas, I shouldn't have. ""Babylon"" certainly is well done from a technical perspective (photography, editing, musical score), but it misfires badly from a substantive perspective. The storyline is supposed to show us how Hollywood's transition from silent films into talkies was a success for some and a disaster for others. But what we get to see here is a self-indulgent, unfocused, and over-long movie, torpedoed by its weak script. (Can someone please tell me what the point of the snake fight scene was? Or of the freak show towards the end of the film? And that's just naming those two). The all-star cast certainly gives its best shot with the weak material that they are given, but in the end this film cannot be saved. This is 3+ hours of my live I'm never getting back.""Babylon"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but COVID had other ideas. It was just released in US theaters this past weekend, and vastly underperformed at the box office. Let's just say it as it is: it tanked. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 10 people). I cannot imagine that Babylon will have long legs at the box office, or that it will pick up a bunch of Oscar nominations. For that the movie is simply too weak, too long and over-indulgent for its own good. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you liked Chazelle's earlier films, I'd suggest you check this out (albeit with low expectations), and draw your own expectation.",babylon releas min open bel air ca find massiv hand parti sex drug de rigueur jack conrad big movi star becom center parti upon arriv also nelli laroy beauti brash aspir actress also manuel torr hope find job movi industri point minut film coupl comment latest writer produc director damien chazel let admit front absolut love three prior movi whiplash la la land first man henc went film high expect ala babylon certainli well done technic perspect photographi edit music score misfir badli substant perspect storylin suppos show us hollywood transit silent film talki success disast other get see self indulg unfocus long movi torpedo weak script someon pleas tell point snake fight scene freak show toward end film name two star cast certainli give best shot weak materi given end film cannot save hour live never get back babylon suppos releas year ago covid idea releas us theater past weekend vastli underperform box offic let say tank tuesday earli even screen saw local arthous theater cincinnati attend okay count peopl cannot imagin babylon long leg box offic pick bunch oscar nomin movi simpli weak long indulg good cours take word like chazel earlier film suggest check albeit low expect draw expect
58,Babylon,Damien's Inferno,3,"In the words of SuperHotFire, I'm about to end Damien Chazelle's whole career.Babylon is a preposterously bad movie. At the same it's an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life. It's aggressively vile. For the vast majority of three hours, you are locked in with this movie as it assaults you with graphic visual depictions of virtually every bodily function imaginable. Supposedly, this is a commentary on the evil, exploitative and corrupt studio system that destroyed old Hollywood. Damien Chazelle, having started his career planting a sloppy wet kiss on the industry with the maudlin, yet beautifully constructed La La Land comes back 6 years later with a film filled with nothing but hatred and anger. But at the same time, that's still not what Babylon wants to be. It wants to be an unforgettable epic. Chazelle wants to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese and P. T. Anderson. He wanted to make a film that sweepingly celebrates the beauty and horror of an American artistic movement. He's so emotionally invested as a Hollywood man that its driven him completely insane. Not since Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate has such a psychotic Hollywood movie been made. If it had just been a Molotov cocktail thrown at Hollywood, and nothing more, Babylon could have been a stroke of genius. Instead, it is so gluttonously self-indulgent and conceptually unstable, that I've lost any kind of respect that I may have had for Chazelle as a director before.Now let's take a step back. Are there any redeeming qualities about Babylon? Yes. Two scenes in particular showcase the immense skill that Chazelle still has as a director and offer glimpses of the kind of good movie Babylon could have been. The scene that details the grueling creation of the first talking movie is both hilarious and exhilarating in showing how impossible it was to work with the new technology. When the film points to the lengths at which Hollywood executives exploited their new silver screen stars through their race and gender, it offers a stunningly profound depiction of the emotional abuse that was inflicted on the actors. But all of that is buried under an avalanche of sophomoric pornography. When the characters aren't cursing like truck drivers, they are having ravenous sex or projectile vomiting, or urinating on each other. This film wants to be The Wolf of Wall Street, Boogie Nights and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas all at the same time. But it's none of those films. It is instead a fascinating race to the bottom. I can't say that I wasn't entertained by the experience. I was wildly amused by it, in fact. But I also felt dirty as I walked out of the theater seeing this. Only see this film if you are with an audience of people who are blacked-out drunk or so high that they cover the screen with pot smoke. I'd assume that would be a blast of an experience.",word superhotfir end damien chazel whole career babylon preposter bad movi experi rememb rest life aggress vile vast major three hour lock movi assault graphic visual depict virtual everi bodili function imagin supposedli commentari evil exploit corrupt studio system destroy old hollywood damien chazel start career plant sloppi wet kiss industri maudlin yet beauti construct la la land come back year later film fill noth hatr anger time still babylon want want unforgett epic chazel want mention breath scorses p anderson want make film sweepingli celebr beauti horror american artist movement emot invest hollywood man driven complet insan sinc michael cimino heaven gate psychot hollywood movi made molotov cocktail thrown hollywood noth babylon could stroke geniu instead glutton self indulg conceptu unstabl lost kind respect may chazel director let take step back redeem qualiti babylon ye two scene particular showcas immens skill chazel still director offer glimps kind good movi babylon could scene detail gruel creation first talk movi hilari exhilar show imposs work new technolog film point length hollywood execut exploit new silver screen star race gender offer stunningli profound depict emot abus inflict actor buri avalanch sophomor pornographi charact curs like truck driver raven sex projectil vomit urin film want wolf wall street boogi night fear loath la vega time none film instead fascin race bottom say entertain experi wildli amus fact also felt dirti walk theater see see film audienc peopl black drunk high cover screen pot smoke assum would blast experi
59,Babylon,Decadence,7,"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.",babylon long messi repuls magnet spectacl unfortun despit great perform set piec live chazel previou work movi want bring wast yard hollywood pull see beauti grow trash problem movi spend much time mud goe deep time tri pull end late upsid cast great almost complet carri movi especi margot robbi enthral perform nelli chazel previou work set piec well execut charact memor howev posit could complet overcom movi fundament flaw go far tri revolt audienc point childish spend enough time charact import scene despit decad runtim end come complet pretenti context practic cynic everyth lead end babylon serv purpos entertain spectacl like hollywood critiqu self indulg prevent achiev great
60,Babylon,A cinematic experience,10,"Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever.",babylon cinemat marvel damien chazel messi dazzl epic masterpiec film yet accept damien chazel call babylon hate letter hollywood love letter movi messi dazzl epic support simplist idea set earli day cinema talk pictur jaw drop phenomenon hollywood still creat babylon suggest deeper realiti film industri raw self destruct narcissist impuls gloriou magic result alway opposit part whole chazel ambit huge babylon full remark set piec richli drawn charact music danc love betray film strength make seriou flaw includ mani end wrong head relianc singin rain touchston babylon make groan occasion mani time long exhilar stretch mesmeris one film multipl end leap ahead major charact sit cinema tear watch singin rain enamour movi scene fresh sinc sullivan travel mention cinema paradiso year empir light fact scene view homag film make less clich montag movi histori bravura needless coda best chazel film cinemat marvel evid enough movi magic sweep us beauti terribl world recognis hollywood even cast babylon amaz almost eerili sync tast actor deepli love like taylor nichol ethan suple show oh briefli cast director francin maisler thumb mental rolodex said ah anoth face sonni would like see perhap anoth reason found drawn babylon excess like spend time almost everyon big beauti screen fell love cast stori believ babylon thu miss last minut fit almost serendipit way end movi audienc come go ephemer ever chang name marque darken theater fill flicker light etern everlast deathless actor audienc alik come go show goe forev
61,Babylon,"A big, bloated, shapeless mess, filled with lazy caricatures",4,"I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera. But ultimately I think Chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it.",seen four damien chazel movi none struck especi satisfi one three joyless hour gave bare moment pleasur perfect exampl phrase often use esquir wretch excess purport part rather trite creation love letter movi spend time trash hollywood pit debaucheri slander never feel remot authent even though rais kenneth anger hollywood babylon film titil us pulp magazin fantasi subterranean cavern outsid citi torchlight jade angeleno gaze tortur rat swallow deprav act cast charact overprivileg fade film star shallow wildli hedonist sexpot heroin loyal upright mexican immigr cynic gossip columnist passel ludicr snooti l millionair catti wive felt like old cartoon even crowd protract orgi open movi felt choreograph utterli fake frenet cheer danc gesticul time caricatur hieronymu bosch next moment transform sedat respect nightclub audienc silent librari appreci music film well decor hundr extra constantli move camera ultim think chezel provid way larg budget simpli squander
62,Babylon,An indulgent mess with surprisingly little to say,4,"Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" isn't one of them. 4/10.",given whiplash la la land outstand film seem reason hope expect director damien chazel new film would deliv seem uniqu spectacl excess debaucheri hollywood would combin flashi hope given chazel previou track record compel stori profound charact develop tragic howev babylon bloat misfir end uniqu wrong reason right bat chazel bring viewer along ride end fusillad puls pound jazz music whirlwind hedon increasingli sophomor eye roll moment would fine coher stori contextu justif indulg ala except well direct film scorses goodfella even wolf wall street paul thoma anderson boogi night complet wrap around crackerjack virtuoso sens intens simultan complement narr unfortun babylon debaucheri start get increasingli tire charact thinli written especi chazel standard uninterest contrast better film excess keep viewer wholli engag long runtim film plot pretti loos unengag gargantuan minut runtim help matter much either perform fine unexcept yet even talent actor cast elev disappoint sometim pointless screenwrit given work result movi feel far less satisfi impact especi sinc mani move part realli add anyth even film messag magic cinema come bit hollow given mani far better film dealt topic hope chazel next film stronger one someth eagerli await given previou work certainli clearli qualifi make great film unfortun babylon one
63,Babylon,desperately trying too hard,6,"It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far.

They drink and drug excessively. They have outrageous and decadent parties all the time. They have all the fame and fortune in the world and it's never enough for them. I honestly don't have too much sympathy for them in many ways. This movie has no actual plot. It's just spoiled actors acting like whiny children. It also is excessively long at over three hours of Hollywood psychosis.I for one don't worship actors like this movie wants me to. They aren't my gods. They are just people who get paid way too much for their profession. Hollywood was depraved back in the 20's and it still is now. I don't need to be reminded of that.,movi show spoil rotten actor get paid massiv amount money pretend someon drink drug excess outrag decad parti time fame fortun world never enough honestli much sympathi mani way movi actual plot spoil actor act like whini children also excess long three hour hollywood psychosi one worship actor like movi want god peopl get paid way much profess hollywood deprav back still need remind
67,Babylon,That was awful.,2,"SCORE: 2.0/10My brain hurts. Wow that was awful. I wouldn't even make my worst enemy have to sit and watch that for 3+ hours. Did some of the people who reviewed this take some of that stuff they kept showing throughout the film? That was a complete mess.It was just unorganized chaos. The only bright spot, if there was one, was Margot Robbie. I am in love with that woman. She was a part of some of the films best scenes, but there weren't many of those. No matter how amazing she was, I couldn't get over how terrible what I was watching was, with a plot that was all over the place and consistently boring. This movie had no business being over 3 hrs long. I don't even have the energy to write more about this film.",score brain hurt wow aw even make worst enemi sit watch hour peopl review take stuff kept show throughout film complet mess unorgan chao bright spot one margot robbi love woman part film best scene mani matter amaz get terribl watch plot place consist bore movi busi hr long even energi write film
68,Babylon,I thought it was great!,8,"Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.Babylon had an impressive ensemble cast lead by Margot Robbie. There were a few stories going through the movie and they intertwined really well. Never a dull moment at all, and thanks to the ensemble cast we got to touch on a lot of subjects that was Old School Hollywood. Socialism, racism, ageism, sexism. An all across the broad look just showing you how it wasAnd speaking of never a dull moment, going into this, I thought this movie was just going to be about a Hollywood party (technically, you can say the movie is about keeping the party going). The movie is long but it worth it because those scenes where they showed you how Hollywood Partied almost 100 years ago. You could never get away with that kind of epicness now.Plus, it was a visually stunning film too. Enjoyable from beginning to end.",person sucker movi old school hollywood film satir transit silent film talki call like film much moment cool frustrat ad sound movi filmmak use freedom given without new technolog new technolog effect movi star time still peopl earth mani complet understand game changer sound hollywood thought film captur brilliantli babylon impress ensembl cast lead margot robbi stori go movi intertwin realli well never dull moment thank ensembl cast got touch lot subject old school hollywood social racism ageism sexism across broad look show wasand speak never dull moment go thought movi go hollywood parti technic say movi keep parti go movi long worth scene show hollywood parti almost year ago could never get away kind epic plu visual stun film enjoy begin end
69,Babylon,"A Forever Party, An Unfading Generation",8,"When the movie starts off with a first-person-POV shot of a guy getting showered by damp, steaming, elephant feces, you know the rated-R Damien Chazelle is back, yet this time rather than bombards of profanity, it's the orgy, the indulgence, the ecstasy. The combined usage of long takes, close-ups, and handheld shots portray the environment, emotion, and atmosphere to their fullest extent, exhibiting the directory's impeccable costume design and scenic layout. Despite the film mainly concentrating on the early theatrical industry, Chazelle still managed to merge his favorite jazz component into the storyline, and the overall soundtrack is, though not as pervasive and brainwashing as La La Land's, melodically memorable, ornamenting the flamboyant history with a light touch of sentiment. Plot-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the individual character's venture, rise, and decadence while interacting with themselves, one another, and the changing world of cinematic art, which I found delightfully reminiscent of Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster. However, the introduction of Tobey Maguire's figure and the underground Tim Burton circus is entirely unnecessary and tedious, wrecking the pacing. In addition, the final montage of film segments is overly personalized to the point of being bewildering - in summary, not the best resolution.I can't help but be amazed by these two mesmerizing characters and their respective performers, so spoilers might be included as I analyze them.Nellie LaRoy by Margot Robbie, an unstoppable, blazing, and audacious child; like a flame glaring too brightly to be approached, or a gale dashing too swiftly to be accepted. You can see all of Harley Quinn's nerve, Tonya Harding's tenacity, and Naomi Lapagilla's seductiveness in this mysterious belle, as she is meant to be the center of attention. Such dreamlike symbol of talent, vivacity, and desire is afterall human: implied misery from orginal family, addiction to drugs and gambling, and tacit communal repulsion gradually diminishes her light. Although her tragedy is destined, I believe such crucial character deserves a better, perhaps more elaborate, ending than simply vanishing into the dark intersection and announced dead on the newspaper.Jack Conrad by Brad Pitt, an ambitious, revered, and humorous celebrity; the wrinkles indicate his age that's slow to tidal changes, yet his three spouses younger and younger of age reflect a denial to time. Finally, his continual inebriation is sobered by the critic's censure and the audience's snicker, as the high tower of accomplishment is shattered. In one conversation with Lady Fay, Pitt absolutely defines what Award-winning-performance truly means, as all of nostalgia, melancholy, and relief can be found in his storyful glances and flickering tears - after ""betrayals"", compromises, and youth no more, Fay is still given the opportunity to renovate in foreign land, while Conrad is but a tired shell without purpose. In his ultimate act, Jack leaves all joy to those around him, and chooses to live in the era where he belongs, which is why the gun-held hand doesn't tremble.Some complains that the film speaks of too much, yet I think it speaks too little of everything, with much blankness to be interpreted and resonated. To the very least, I can imagine myself rewatching Babylon many times in the future.",movi start first person pov shot guy get shower damp steam eleph fece know rate r damien chazel back yet time rather bombard profan orgi indulg ecstasi combin usag long take close up handheld shot portray environ emot atmospher fullest extent exhibit directori impecc costum design scenic layout despit film mainli concentr earli theatric industri chazel still manag merg favorit jazz compon storylin overal soundtrack though pervas brainwash la la land melod memor ornament flamboy histori light touch sentiment plot wise thoroughli enjoy individu charact ventur rise decad interact one anoth chang world cinemat art found delight reminisc wong kar wai grandmast howev introduct tobey maguir figur underground tim burton circu entir unnecessari tediou wreck pace addit final montag film segment overli person point bewild summari best resolut help amaz two mesmer charact respect perform spoiler might includ analyz nelli laroy margot robbi unstopp blaze audaci child like flame glare brightli approach gale dash swiftli accept see harley quinn nerv tonya hard tenac naomi lapagilla seduct mysteri bell meant center attent dreamlik symbol talent vivac desir afteral human impli miseri orgin famili addict drug gambl tacit commun repuls gradual diminish light although tragedi destin believ crucial charact deserv better perhap elabor end simpli vanish dark intersect announc dead newspap jack conrad brad pitt ambiti rever humor celebr wrinkl indic age slow tidal chang yet three spous younger younger age reflect denial time final continu inebri sober critic censur audienc snicker high tower accomplish shatter one convers ladi fay pitt absolut defin award win perform truli mean nostalgia melancholi relief found story glanc flicker tear betray compromis youth fay still given opportun renov foreign land conrad tire shell without purpos ultim act jack leav joy around choos live era belong gun held hand trembl complain film speak much yet think speak littl everyth much blank interpret reson least imagin rewatch babylon mani time futur
70,Babylon,"The darkside of the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"".",8,"I see that this movie is being considered a bomb. I can see why considering the movie runs for three hours. I was blessed with a private showing. Actually I was the only one in theater. While the movie was slow it was interesting. The movie revolves around three main characters: Manny Torres played by Diego Calva, Manny's quick thinking helps saves the day and puts him on the radar of the brass and his star rises to the title of being in charge of MGM's Latin America divison and eventually being the handler of the newest star Nellie LaRoy played beautifully by Margo Robbie. Then we have actor Jack Conrad silent superstar who like many of his fellow stars of that era had difficulty transfering to ""talkies"".Under Jack Conrad's tuteledge Manny starts rising in Hollywood. While working security for a producer's party he meets Nellie La Roy and a failed romance begins. Nellie La Roy doesn't lack confidence about her becoming a star. When a starlet is unable to show up for tomorrow's shoot it's the standard being in the ""right place at the right time"". When the call: ""Action!"" Ms La Roy blows everyone away with her brassiness and turning into innocence.Jack Conrad is trying to adjust but when he loses the one person who isn't to tell him the truth it's all down hill from there.Suddenly no only does Ms. La Roy developes some vices she foolighly places her trust in her father (wonderfully played by Eric Roberts) her fortune from making movies is squandered. She comes to Manny for help and he of course helps. Needless to say the outcome isn't ""They lived happily ever after.""Shout out to Jean Smart for her ""Hedda Hopper"" chatacter as well as Toby Maguire as the sleazy gangster. Depite the box office both Margo Robbie and Brad Pitt should be nominated for a Best Oscar performance with the former should be the winner.",see movi consid bomb see consid movi run three hour bless privat show actual one theater movi slow interest movi revolv around three main charact manni torr play diego calva manni quick think help save day put radar brass star rise titl charg mgm latin america divison eventu handler newest star nelli laroy play beauti margo robbi actor jack conrad silent superstar like mani fellow star era difficulti transfer talki jack conrad tuteledg manni start rise hollywood work secur produc parti meet nelli la roy fail romanc begin nelli la roy lack confid becom star starlet unabl show tomorrow shoot standard right place right time call action ms la roy blow everyon away brassi turn innoc jack conrad tri adjust lose one person tell truth hill suddenli ms la roy develop vice foolighli place trust father wonder play eric robert fortun make movi squander come manni help cours help needless say outcom live happili ever shout jean smart hedda hopper chatact well tobi maguir sleazi gangster depit box offic margo robbi brad pitt nomin best oscar perform former winner
71,Babylon,"Outstanding, multi-genre mash up with many jaw dropping moments.",9,"Damian Chazelle doesn't make bad movies (whiplash, La La Land, First Man) but much of what I'd heard about Babylon in advance of seeing (no experiencing) it for myself was less than complimentary.Turgid, overlong, rambling, too strident and lacking a narrative.Well, in my view, all of those criticisms are both unfounded and unfair, because Babylon is magnificent.It's an epic story spanning thirty years, beginning in the silent era when Hollywood was in its most outrageous Klondike era.The talkies would pivot the narrative when Al Jolson's Jazz Singer arrived, but for now anything went and that's where the movie begins in a lavish set piece piece that starts with a scatalogical Elephant episode and culminates, some 25 minutes late, in a drug fuelled frenzy at the end of all parties.Then up comes the title credit, fully 25 minutes in.It's jaw dropping and hilarious.We then see the, also hilarious, growth of silent cinema where anyone with a mind, and a budget to do it, can do it. This is where Brad Pitt (a matinee idol in his final years) and Margot Robbie (a wannabe with talent and gumption) dominate proceedings with Robbie putting in a career high performance.In the third act the story slows down considerably and assumes a narrative direction before all hell breaks loose in the penultimate chapter (it turns into a horror film, with a stand out cameo from Toby MaGuire, that morphs into a psychedelic episode that Kubrick would have loved, before reaching its Jazzy musical finale.It's three hours of endless ideas, superb styling, sets and costume design.In using Singing In the Rain as a central plot device, and theme for the movie's funniest sequence on an early sound stage, Chazelle treats us to his first real exploration of humour.It's an homage, as the whole movie is, to the greatest days of hollywood. It's a comedy, a romance, a horror and a musical all rolled into one.And the music. On my, fans of La La Land will enjoy the musical themes that run throughout and are a direct follow up to his first masterpiece.I applauded the movie as the final curtain came down. It contains more ideas, more vitality, more chutzpah than anything I've seen for ages and I for one hope to see it rewarded at the Hollywood gongs night in the spring.Bravo.",damian chazel make bad movi whiplash la la land first man much heard babylon advanc see experienc less complimentari turgid overlong rambl strident lack narr well view critic unfound unfair babylon magnific epic stori span thirti year begin silent era hollywood outrag klondik era talki would pivot narr al jolson jazz singer arriv anyth went movi begin lavish set piec piec start scatalog eleph episod culmin minut late drug fuell frenzi end parti come titl credit fulli minut jaw drop hilari see also hilari growth silent cinema anyon mind budget brad pitt matine idol final year margot robbi wannab talent gumption domin proceed robbi put career high perform third act stori slow consider assum narr direct hell break loos penultim chapter turn horror film stand cameo tobi maguir morph psychedel episod kubrick would love reach jazzi music final three hour endless idea superb style set costum design use sing rain central plot devic theme movi funniest sequenc earli sound stage chazel treat us first real explor humour homag whole movi greatest day hollywood comedi romanc horror music roll one music fan la la land enjoy music theme run throughout direct follow first masterpiec applaud movi final curtain came contain idea vital chutzpah anyth seen age one hope see reward hollywood gong night spring bravo
72,Babylon,Indeed an epic film; not kidding!!!,10,"I love the cinema! Babylon is a spectacular epic film, truly a masterpiece. I think this movie deserves the Oscar for best picture of the year. It is a remarkable story following several characters living the dream and the starlight of Hollywood. Chazelle has created a movie that is a love letter to Hollywood not because of depraved parties or preventing talented minorities from becoming stars but from reflecting how far Hollywood has become.I was amazed by the Oscar-worthy performances from Margot Robbie. She is fantastic and deserves a nomination. Brad Pitt is excellent as well, and the newcomer Mexican actor Diego Calva wow, perfectly carried the whole movie; he had great chemistry with Robbie. Jean Smart was fantastic, specifically the cameo with Brad Pitt, and Tobey Maguire was hilarious. Three hours of such a spectacle from beginning to end. I loved the cinematography, and the musical score is out of this world. You feel you want to dance and sing. The story was great and nostalgic. Come on, people, I can see it was harsh for some prunes not to like the movie because of the sex and drug content, but it is far from being the objective.I loved the cameos of the movie sets that show the evolution from silent to talkies. If you love movies as much as I do, you will love Babylon, and finally, I want to tell you that the ending is epic; I don't want to spoil telling you about it.
