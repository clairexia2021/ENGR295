7,7,Avatar: The Way of Water,Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

459,459,Blonde,Was Expecting Worse,6,"After all of the terrible Internet reviews, I was expecting much worse from ""Blonde."" While I agree that it's not a great, or maybe even very good, movie, it's not terrible, and I'll admit that things about it got under my skin and stayed there, which is always the sign of at least effective filmmaking.I'm sick to death of biopics, and I don't have much interest in Marilyn Monroe. I don't care for her style of acting, and I'm too young to have been witness to her cultural impact at the time she was living. So from the start I'm not the ideal audience for this movie. And I don't know that I fully understand the point of it. I didn't know going in that it was speculative fiction based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel, so I spent much of the running time wondering how accurate it was. It's a 3 hour marathon of nothing but terrible things happening to Monroe, and it all just starts to feel like exploitative misery porn without any point other than that the Hollywood industry treats people, especially women, badly, as if we didn't already know that. There seems to be some effort to show us that Monroe was more than just a dumb blonde, but a feeble effort at best. We don't really ever get to know her or understand her inner life, so she mostly remains an object for the film to abuse. It really just made me feel bad, and I'm tired of seeing movies this year that seem to exist for the sole purpose of making their audiences feel bad. There's been a lot of them.Ana de Armas sure gives herself to the role, but I started to feel almost embarrassed by all the things the movie made her do, and did to her. After a while it felt like I was walking in on her in the middle of a bowel movement. As I write this, de Armas was just nominated for an Oscar for her performance. I don't begrudge her the nomination, because A for effort I guess, though hers wasn't one of my particular favorite performances of the year. And she can't lose her accent for anything.But like I said upfront, the movie did manage to make me feel something, even if that something was mostly bad, which is more than a lot of films do.Grade: C+",terribl internet review expect much wors blond agre great mayb even good movi terribl admit thing got skin stay alway sign least effect filmmak sick death biopic much interest marilyn monro care style act young wit cultur impact time live start ideal audienc movi know fulli understand point know go specul fiction base joyc carol oat novel spent much run time wonder accur hour marathon noth terribl thing happen monro start feel like exploit miseri porn without point hollywood industri treat peopl especi women badli alreadi know seem effort show us monro dumb blond feebl effort best realli ever get know understand inner life mostli remain object film abus realli made feel bad tire see movi year seem exist sole purpos make audienc feel bad lot ana de arma sure give role start feel almost embarrass thing movi made felt like walk middl bowel movement write de arma nomin oscar perform begrudg nomin effort guess though one particular favorit perform year lose accent anyth like said upfront movi manag make feel someth even someth mostli bad lot film grade c,1,0

42,42,The Menu,I'd Like To Take It Back,4,"So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.The film sees a young couple who travel to a Remote Island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the Chef has prepared a lavish & interesting menu. Though as soon as they arrive there, things are not all they seem & the food the Chef brings out makes the couple & everyone else question what is really going on as a sinister feeling starts to boil...!I found the film to be not the greatest. I mean, the first half is great & suspenseful & really keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It really entices you in as there doesn't appear to be anything to make you think something obviously bad is going to happen. So, for the first half it's great, but...The second half is a let down. The film goes completely off the rails, the story itself & its narrative are as clear as mud & there's so many unanswered questions, plot holes & things that happen that go against the main antagonists rules. The ending was just bad also & just plain lazy & too straight forward for a film like this one.The action we did get, the gore & shocking violence were great, but couldn't save this dish, sadly. There's some humour to be had in this film which was good, but again, couldn't salvage this feast even if it wanted to.The film does somewhat drag & the runtime is 100 minutes too long (1 hour & 40 minutes). I also felt the narrative & story arc of the film wasn't clear enough & the ending was totally unsatisfactory. The cast, however, were great. The characters were ok, but the main female lead was pretty unlikable. Chef Slowik was good though.Overall, it's a pretty out there film. Not the greatest & has a clear as mud plot with other elements not aiding in the understanding. The characters are ok, but weak with the except of Chef Slowik, the main antagonist Margo wasn't likable & pretty obnoxious. The films story arc & ending made no sense & had 0 explanation by the final act with a dragged out pacing & runtime. While there was some funny parts & some action/gore, it couldn't save this dish that I would like to take back.4/10.",seen brief preview read briefli entir sure expect horror comedi type film reason went see film see young coupl travel remot island eat exclus restaur chef prepar lavish interest menu though soon arriv thing seem food chef bring make coupl everyon els question realli go sinist feel start boil found film greatest mean first half great suspens realli keep guess go happen next realli entic appear anyth make think someth obvious bad go happen first half great second half let film goe complet rail stori narr clear mud mani unansw question plot hole thing happen go main antagonist rule end bad also plain lazi straight forward film like one action get gore shock violenc great save dish sadli humour film good salvag feast even want film somewhat drag runtim minut long hour minut also felt narr stori arc film clear enough end total unsatisfactori cast howev great charact ok main femal lead pretti unlik chef slowik good though overal pretti film greatest clear mud plot element aid understand charact ok weak except chef slowik main antagonist margo likabl pretti obnoxi film stori arc end made sens explan final act drag pace runtim funni part action gore save dish would like take back,0,0
377,377,Skinamarink,House Of Leaves.,6,"I just watched it, and I dug it. In many respects it reminded of the book House Of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. A book that has a similar theme of a house that has rooms that constantly change, people disappear etc. And as someone that has grown up watching experimental films, as well as listening to and making experimental music, I thought the pace of the film was just right.The power of suggestion is always a good thing, and the fact that there was little footage of actual people present here works well. It added to the sense of isolation in the house. The whispering too was a nice touch. The children sensed there was something there.I also found the atmosphere throughout kind of relaxing.

99,99,Knock at the Cabin,"This movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have",6,"Knock at the Cabin (2023) is a new M. Night Shyamalan picture my wife and I caught at an A24 Advance Screening last night. The storyline follows two men and their daughter on vacation at a cabin in the woods. They are visited and captured by four individuals who come out of the woods with an ultimatum...one of the three must die at the hands of the other two or the world will end. As time runs down the family sees the death and destruction the visitors promised. Will the family let everyone die, will they save the world or is it all an elaborate game being played by four psychopaths?As previously referenced, this picture is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Rupert Grint (Harry Potter), Ben Aldridge (Our Girl), Nikki Amuka-Bird (Jupiter Ascending), Jonathan Groff (The Matrix: Resurrection) and Abby Quinn (After the Wedding).The storyline and characters in this picture had a lot of potential; but unfortunately, every situation is straightforward and predictable, all the way to the final scene. It's too bad because the cinematography and camera angles are very good and Dave Bautista delivers an outstanding performance. His character was easily my favorite. However, the characters backstories needed to be more developed, more like The Stand, before they all met at the cabin. I didn't really care what happened to those characters (the decisions were too easy to make for the family). The kill scenes themselves needed more gore and intensity. They definitely could have been better executed to highlight the situation the parents were in. The conclusion is straightforward and you know what's going to happen and how.Unfortunately, this movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",knock cabin new night shyamalan pictur wife caught advanc screen last night storylin follow two men daughter vacat cabin wood visit captur four individu come wood ultimatum one three must die hand two world end time run famili see death destruct visitor promis famili let everyon die save world elabor game play four psychopath previous referenc pictur direct night shyamalan sign star dave bautista guardian galaxi rupert grint harri potter ben aldridg girl nikki amuka bird jupit ascend jonathan groff matrix resurrect abbi quinn wed storylin charact pictur lot potenti unfortun everi situat straightforward predict way final scene bad cinematographi camera angl good dave bautista deliv outstand perform charact easili favorit howev charact backstori need develop like stand met cabin realli care happen charact decis easi make famili kill scene need gore intens definit could better execut highlight situat parent conclus straightforward know go happen unfortun movi need twist turn strang problem night shyamalan movi would score recommend see,1,0
333,333,Blood,wow...,8,"I cant phatom what amount of story and joy a handful of blood can make on the great big silverscreen , its no irony that blood is thicker than water and that its iron taste may make some people go freaked out, in a bloodfamily that has enough to deal with from before...a really different horrorthriller on the bloody banks of the lake behind the house starts a medical issue that only will be treated with rawblood taken per os.

386,386,Magic Mke,"Trailer is misleading, great movie though",8,"The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.Soderbergh crafts a powerful but almost self-defeating film that I doubt will be a huge popularity winner due to its unconventional story. (Sidenote: why is it that filmmakers can make critically-acclaimed masterpieces about female strippers/prostitutes, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if the g-string is on the other gender it's just goofy fun?) Due to its deceptive marketing, ""Magic Mike"" is passed off as crowd-pleasing entertainment, but it's really a very sobering look at life with more introspective moments than laughs.Channing Tatum plays Mike, a guy with the bod of a Greek god, probably not very educated but with a very smart, creative ambition: to build artistic furniture. Somehow, instead, he ends up thrusting his pelvis on stage for screaming ladies. Enter Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year-old kid who, like many 19-year-olds, doesn't have a clue. Mike takes Adam under his wing and introduces him to the night life, all the while promising Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that he'll take care of Adam.If you can see where this is going, then great. That's the point. ""Magic Mike"" does something that few films have the guts to do. It sets up a predictable situation and then takes us through exactly that. No wacky, contrived plot twists necessary. Instead it focuses on how different people react and change when confronted with a predictable set of events.Another thing this film does, better than any other I've seen in recent memory, is that it gives us REAL dialogue. I'm talking about the scenes between Mike & Brooke. It's every bit as real as something you'd experience in real life, right down to the stammering, the awkward fidgeting, the ""flubbed lines"". I put that in quotations because I'm not sure if the script was written that way, or if Tatum actually flubbed a few lines and Soderbergh left them in. My point is that the dialogue & chemistry between those two is so believable you'd think they didn't have a camera on them.""Magic Mike"" is not for everyone. It can't be accurately summed up with some exuberant catchphrase like ""Laugh out loud funny!"" or ""A tragic masterpiece!"" or ""Nail biting suspense!"" Also I would say that this is a very uncomfortable date movie, a very uncomfortable bro movie, and it's probably too heavy for a fun, gal's night out movie. If you do see it, it's probably best watched alone so you can really soak in the personal story it's telling. On an individual level I think we can all relate to the idea of being sidetracked by the pursuit of a dream, rather than the dream itself, regardless of if we're guys wearing buttless cowboy pants in front of 200 squealing, undersexed women.",upbeat trailer quippi banter cute gag promis washboard ab tight tushi mislead imdb plot summari make want hurl male stripper teach younger perform parti pick women make easi money magic mike great movi differ reason differ audienc trailer may attract fun wild romp quirki romcom lot chuckl complex drama focus success vs illus success could set wall street could set law firm could set one paragon success envis hear word instead set male nudi bar ton hormon rage women wave hurl stuf bill men thong underwear soderbergh craft power almost self defeat film doubt huge popular winner due unconvent stori sidenot filmmak make critic acclaim masterpiec femal stripper prostitut like leav la vega g string gender goofi fun due decept market magic mike pass crowd pleas entertain realli sober look life introspect moment laugh chan tatum play mike guy bod greek god probabl educ smart creativ ambit build artist furnitur somehow instead end thrust pelvi stage scream ladi enter adam alex pettyf year old kid like mani year old clue mike take adam wing introduc night life promis adam sister brook codi horn take care adam see go great point magic mike someth film gut set predict situat take us exactli wacki contriv plot twist necessari instead focus differ peopl react chang confront predict set event anoth thing film better seen recent memori give us real dialogu talk scene mike brook everi bit real someth experi real life right stammer awkward fidget flub line put quotat sure script written way tatum actual flub line soderbergh left point dialogu chemistri two believ think camera magic mike everyon accur sum exuber catchphras like laugh loud funni tragic masterpiec nail bite suspens also would say uncomfort date movi uncomfort bro movi probabl heavi fun gal night movi see probabl best watch alon realli soak person stori tell individu level think relat idea sidetrack pursuit dream rather dream regardless guy wear buttless cowboy pant front squeal undersex women,1,1

It's the story of Jessica Watsonl who's always dreamed of sailing around the world by herself. She's on a quest to be the younger person to do so.As you'd expect, she certainly has her share of obstacles. But she shows the true grit needed to complete such an adventure. The film goes from her at sea, to flashbacks of her growing up and all the things that led to this amazing adventure.I thought the acting was absolutely spot on. The photography and special effects were tremendous as well. And it's full of breathtaking action scenes that make you feel you're on board with her. There's one absolutely gorgeous scene when she's caught in a dead-air zone. She stares at the night sky just full of stars with the David Bowie's ""Star Man"" quietly playing.

257,257,Shotgun Wedding,Big messy fun,7,"It's no Oscar contender folks, and it didn't try to be. It's overall a mixed-bag full of some big laughs but also jokes that fall flat on their face.If you're into romantic comedies you'll find it humorous. I watched it with my boyfriend, mother and sister and we all laughed more than once and stayed entertained up until the end.Jennifer Lopez might as well be put on a stake at this point. Nothing but ""she's such a terrible actress"", ""she can't act out of a bag"", etc. Etc. To find here according to the negative comments. Calm down silly kids; people who can't act don't get continuously cast in leading roles for 30+ years. Sorry, that lame excuse is mute at this point.The chemistry is a bit to be desired between JLo and Josh Duhamel. The latter pulls off some tough scenes that other actors wouldn't have pulled off so smoothly without being so used to this material. I last enjoyed him in the other superior ""Life As We Know It"" off-playing Ms. Katherine Heigl and he does fine here. They have cute moments. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required.Cheech Marin and Jennifer Coolidge are almost in throw away roles, however Ms. Coolidge has had a sudden rise with ""Single All the Way"", ""The White Lotus"" and other very recent shows and movies under her belt.

53,53,Babylon,"Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!",4,"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.",main takeaway left theater even watch film far long probabl one storylin mani make movi fli instead first act drag drag drag funni thing best moment film within first hour less cohes chaotic film excit felt point though film fall apart plotlin stray film mayb crazi energi first third attempt tri regain energi final quit captur came turn debaucheri horror gel well felt like tone contradict began act hand fantast robbi pitt electr way diego calva emot without say anyth brilliant wish script direct la la land writer director damien chazel good act sometim film felt like watch four film time plotlin could movi see jumbl togeth felt self indulg exhaust end one storylin sort end make feel justifi tell afterward credit start roll sat feel wit littl three hour overal recommend peopl mind three hour runtim keep mind film plot goe absolut nowher although might fun trip time rather pointless one talk pictur,0,0

368,368,Skinamarink,A chilling finale did not make up for the boring events leading up to it,4,"All the people saying this film is plotless are wrong. There is a plot here, although it is extemely vague and thin. Might be one of the thinnest plotlines I've ever seen and that is what caused the film to be at times unbearably boring for me. I actually enjoyed the aesthetic for the film, the faceless characters, the low light, lofi camera work. It's a style that could present a high creep factor with the proper story to go along with it. This is not that story.I will say this is much better than the director's previous effort 'Heck', which is basically the short film that started this one. It feels like the director has a better grip on the style he's presenting here. That still doesn't make up for the lack of story here.The film opens with one of the children falling down the stairs and this starts the chain of events that make me believe the child actually died when this happened and he is living in some purgatory or hell. What follows after this could only be described as mean spirited and harsh, but it unfolds so slowly that you feel like you're just watching paint dry. There are some suitably creepy moments but they are few and far between. Actually there is maybe about 3 or 4 creepy scenes in the entire film, the ending being far and wide the most uncomfortable. Had me looking over my shoulder as I was leaving the theater.(I had the whole theater to myself, I'm assuming due to bad weather, but it was probably the best way to watch this film as isolation is a major theme.) The ending felt like I was being personally talked to by the faceless, out of focus boy and I hated it, but in a good way.All in all, I still couldn't call this a good movie and it will only appeal to a very niche horror crowd. I commend the director for creating something so different. I just wish there was as much thought put into the story as there was in the shooting style.2 portals out of 5.",peopl say film plotless wrong plot although extem vagu thin might one thinnest plotlin ever seen caus film time unbear bore actual enjoy aesthet film faceless charact low light lofi camera work style could present high creep factor proper stori go along stori say much better director previou effort heck basic short film start one feel like director better grip style present still make lack stori film open one children fall stair start chain event make believ child actual die happen live purgatori hell follow could describ mean spirit harsh unfold slowli feel like watch paint dri suitabl creepi moment far actual mayb creepi scene entir film end far wide uncomfort look shoulder leav theater whole theater assum due bad weather probabl best way watch film isol major theme end felt like person talk faceless focu boy hate good way still call good movi appeal nich horror crowd commend director creat someth differ wish much thought put stori shoot style portal,0,0

164,164,"Alice, Darling","Thanks to the beginning director and writers, the story unfortunately remains a bit on the simple side.",5,"Alice, Darling is a new drama thriller directed by Mary Nighy. This is the first movie she has directed and has only directed some episodes of different TV series before this.In the film, Alice (Anna Kendrick) goes away with her friends Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku) and Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) for Tess's birthday. She lies to her partner Simon (Charlie Carrick) about this. She has an uneasy relationship with Simon, in which Simon always dominantly makes the decisions for them.This lie turns Alice's time with her friends from a fun girls' trip into a precarious one. For example, Alice begins to wonder if she should go public with her problems to her friends. This can only completely ruin the fun.Besides the fact that this is only the first film that Mary Nighy has directed, this is also only the second film for which writers Alanna Francis and Mark Van de Ven have written the story. Because of the starting sides of both of them, they keep this film a bit on the simple side. Unfortunately, the message about someone who is in an uncomfortable relationship with a partner who makes all the choices is not very strong.With this film they also take their time to make it clear to you as a viewer what exactly this film is about. For example, in the beginning you first have to try to guess what kind of film you are going to see. The storytelling of the film is unfortunately a bit on the rushed side, so the film sometimes jumps quickly from scene to scene, to show some different moments. As a result, the story can sometimes remain a bit difficult to follow and the film is sometimes filled with unnecessary scenes, which have little or no value for the final ending.It also takes a while before you clearly learn about the different relationships between all the characters. As a result, the acting in the beginning of the film unfortunately does not come across very well at first. Fortunately, this changes later in the film and most actors know how to act better and more clearly. You just keep missing a clearer history of the characters, to really understand them. Due to the lack of background information and some lack of other details, the film sometimes comes across as too rushed or simple. As a viewer, this makes you wonder why the characters can't just talk about each other's problems as friends.Anna Kendrick looks good in the lead role, but this is not her best acting. She has done better acting in her other films. Kaniehtiio is also more of a TV actress and knows how to do nice acting, but does not do anything special with her role. Wunmi Mosaku plays more like the backbone of the girlfriend group, trying to balance everything between everyone. Charlie Carrick unfortunately comes forward a bit too exaggerated in his role, so that the film loses some of its credibility.",alic darl new drama thriller direct mari nighi first movi direct direct episod differ tv seri film alic anna kendrick goe away friend sophi wunmi mosaku tess kaniehtiio horn tess birthday lie partner simon charli carrick uneasi relationship simon simon alway dominantli make decis lie turn alic time friend fun girl trip precari one exampl alic begin wonder go public problem friend complet ruin fun besid fact first film mari nighi direct also second film writer alanna franci mark van de ven written stori start side keep film bit simpl side unfortun messag someon uncomfort relationship partner make choic strong film also take time make clear viewer exactli film exampl begin first tri guess kind film go see storytel film unfortun bit rush side film sometim jump quickli scene scene show differ moment result stori sometim remain bit difficult follow film sometim fill unnecessari scene littl valu final end also take clearli learn differ relationship charact result act begin film unfortun come across well first fortun chang later film actor know act better clearli keep miss clearer histori charact realli understand due lack background inform lack detail film sometim come across rush simpl viewer make wonder charact talk problem friend anna kendrick look good lead role best act done better act film kaniehtiio also tv actress know nice act anyth special role wunmi mosaku play like backbon girlfriend group tri balanc everyth everyon charli carrick unfortun come forward bit exagger role film lose credibl,0,0
26,26,The Menu,A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today,10,"From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger. As the chef pointed out, they didn't try hard enough to fight back. It was as if they all had already accepted the menu. In the final scene, you can see some of them even thanking chef.Though some of them tried to escape, they didn't fight back. Margot fought back, against the menu, by sending it back and being authentic with herself and then with the chef.",start trailer think mani realiz typic film mean cannot watch stori narr understand represent satir satir premis film lose passion purpos chef suicid tendenc plot film lose purpos joy desir fulfil purpos reflect also convers margot also felt way work actor chef call actor lost purpos end margot call said chef one purpos purpos creat food custom might enjoy fail whole premis whole point film chef fail societi tendenc pressur pleas tri pleas imposs end lose purpos joy desir chef invit peopl blame ruin art life end straight point margot someth chef wait told authent truth everyon afraid afraid chef afraid offend margot never like food start want send back stop tyler end face death stood told chef truth like food courag send back chef ask want eat rememb photo saw room one time chef ever smile back start greasi teen back knew joy purpos chef serv food custom pleas statu quo remind rememb said toward end pain almost gone almost took away pain remind joy cook sum point movi restaur america becom today becom nation bent pleas unpleas peopl longer own nation like chef own instead wealthi angel investor like chef includ rest staff joy soul purpos nation erod away cheeseburg repres heart america use like chef cook cheeseburg rememb joy purpos american rememb margot specif ask american chees chef comment best chees melt without split chees constitut bind us togeth american would split chees make cheeseburg chees burger peopl restaur repres variou aspect nation young men young gener ambiti go getter focus work money quit clearli express dialog old coupl repres old polit gener taken everyth grant server ask handl right left also notic husband old white male specif case skinni blond wife shoulder length hair dress old fashion server chose left hand chef mock donkey final clue margot reveal chef rattl pretti direct clue specif satir movi star assist repres wash name drop hollywood chef said lost purpos critic editor repres media review give rise downfal restaur chef said mani live ruin coast guard feder agent like fbi cia etc yet part kitchen tyler know young colleg gener think know everyth work head knowledg life experi polit talk think run countri better realli put test fail like tyler kitchen dish call bs margot chef said work class servic provid nonsens peopl want cheeseburg rememb said imagin restaur actual design serv actual food bread scene version emperor new cloth everyon knew bread play along groupthink pretend actual dish margot one buy call food young men acknowledg dish want special treatment one bread use name posit tri get bread end margot establish server custom relationship realiz along st moment chef talk chef look rememb want send food back also remind tyler pay serv chef misplac one server context scene server custom last scene pivot outright said eater led revel stand custom return menu ask cheeseburg chef allow leav want go custom alway right remind constitut republ politician work us peopl like margot need establish fix relationship order nation surviv otherwis like everyon els restaur knew go die littl prevent demis simpli part menu chef actual brought point coast guard came even margot got could thing ask cheeseburg chef point tri hard enough fight back alreadi accept menu final scene see even thank chef though tri escap fight back margot fought back menu send back authent chef,1,0
84,84,You People,Cringeworthy,2,"You People is so poorly written and 'unintentionally' racist that you'd think it was written by Michael Scott.

Actually, I'm not entirely sure what their message was supposed to be but to me it basically came off as promoting segregation.This movie is pretty much a symbol of everything wrong with post-2015 Hollywood social commentaries... it's almost like twitter addiction has melted the mind of every writer in LA. It got so bad at points that I started to wonder if it was a conservative strawman/parody of urban progressives.Beyond that the jokes/culture references are mostly 10 years out of date and unfunny, the soundtrack rarely aligns with the scenes it plays over, the transitions between scenes look straight out of a mid 2000's disney channel show, and I'm not sure what possessed the creators to cast Jonah Hill of all people as a 'likable' lead in a romantic comedy -- it just doesn't work.",peopl poorli written unintent racist think written michael scott entir movi basic amalgam worst stereotyp around black muslim use air quot charact actual noi member movi misleadingli portray muslim jewish peopl despit messag purportedli opposit actual entir sure messag suppos basic came promot segreg movi pretti much symbol everyth wrong post hollywood social commentari almost like twitter addict melt mind everi writer la got bad point start wonder conserv strawman parodi urban progress beyond joke cultur refer mostli year date unfunni soundtrack rare align scene play transit scene look straight mid disney channel show sure possess creator cast jonah hill peopl likabl lead romant comedi work,0,0

A violent storm strikes the plane causing them to land in a remote island somewhere in the Philippines filled with armed rebels. Brodie Torrance, Gaspare, and the military must rescue and escape with the crew and passengers before everything goes wrong. Overall, I liked it for what it is that a plane crash goes wrong and has to rescue everyone safely from the rebels. Also, Gerard Butler does not miss with his action films in this one.

153,153,"Alice, Darling",Strong performances but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would,6,"Alice, Darling (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of friends who decide to go on a girl trip to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of the friends, Alice, has a psychological and verbally abusive boyfriend she needs to lie to, to go on the trip. She spends the entire trip scares to death he will find out about the trip. As her friends discover what's bothering her they will do their best to help her overcome her fears.This movie is directed by Mary Nighy (Traces) in her major motion picture directorial debut and stars Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Kaniehtiio Horn (Possessor), Charlie Carrick (Deep Water) and Wunmi Mosaku (His House).The storyline for this had a lot of potential and the cast is outstanding and delivers strong performances. The chemistry between the cast was tremendous and felt authentic. You could feel the anxiety oozing through the screen and the friends genuine desperation to help their friend. However, there were decisions throughout the picture by both the friends and Alice that didn't feel realistic and was frustrating. The subplot of Angela missing was under utilized, and while a metaphor, could have had a better conclusion that was more impactful and less subtle. There's a sex scene in here that's the strangest thing I've ever seen. The ending was solid but I thought they'd show more of the husbands abusive ways in an explosive climax.Overall, this is an okay movie with some redeeming elements but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",alic darl movi wife saw theater last night storylin follow group friend decid go girl trip celebr one birthday one friend alic psycholog verbal abus boyfriend need lie go trip spend entir trip scare death find trip friend discov bother best help overcom fear movi direct mari nighi trace major motion pictur directori debut star anna kendrick pitch perfect kaniehtiio horn possessor charli carrick deep water wunmi mosaku hous storylin lot potenti cast outstand deliv strong perform chemistri cast tremend felt authent could feel anxieti ooz screen friend genuin desper help friend howev decis throughout pictur friend alic feel realist frustrat subplot angela miss util metaphor could better conclus impact less subtl sex scene strangest thing ever seen end solid thought show husband abus way explos climax overal okay movi redeem element push envelop far thought would would score recommend see,1,1
91,91,You People,"Well, the formulated message is better than the (should not have been) medicore movie.",5,"Not a surprise, I guess.What did I know about this movie? Eddie Murphy is in it. For me he still has the stigma that I'm gonna get some good laughs if he does this movie. Jonah Hill is in this movie. I think Jonah Hill is funny. He has the perfect wit for Eddie to bounce jokes off of. I also saw in the trailer Nia Long is in it and I felt she was a fine enough actress for Eddie to bounce jokes off of.None of that happened. Julia Louis Dreyfuss and David Duchovny are also in the movie and they were ready to make us laugh and they did but it was so minimal. Can't say I did not laugh but I was hoping this cast would give me far more than they did.There was a point in which comedian Mike Epps, who gave me bigger laughs than Murphy, were doing a scene together and I got nothing.Comedian Andrew Schulz was in the movie, involved in a scene that had me giggling when I should have been busting a gut.All I can say is Kenya Burris hit the motherload with Blackish and the universeish (I don't know if that's what it's called), but he can't replicate it. BlackAF was a very bad replication of Blackish and You People also seems to take elements Burris touched on before, (which is not a bad thing, do what you know) but somehow it just never matches the Gold he did with Blackish.His comedy on mixed relations is getting tired, You People felt tired, and it seemed that all Eddie was doing was playing Kenya Burris and that's not what this movie needed.Not as bad as I am making it out to be but all I see is something that could have been so much better.",surpris guess know movi eddi murphi still stigma gonna get good laugh movi jonah hill movi think jonah hill funni perfect wit eddi bounc joke also saw trailer nia long felt fine enough actress eddi bounc joke none happen julia loui dreyfuss david duchovni also movi readi make us laugh minim say laugh hope cast would give far point comedian mike epp gave bigger laugh murphi scene togeth got noth comedian andrew schulz movi involv scene giggl bust gut say kenya burri hit motherload blackish universeish know call replic blackaf bad replic blackish peopl also seem take element burri touch bad thing know somehow never match gold blackish comedi mix relat get tire peopl felt tire seem eddi play kenya burri movi need bad make see someth could much better,0,1

418,418,Jurassic World:Dominion,They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park,6,"When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.",go jurass park movi want someth els hyper realist dinosaur cool environ see frolic natur habitat defend territori battl dino domin hunt human like open island scene brachiosauru rex reveal rainstorm dinosaur front center origin jurass park inspir sens grandeur awe dinosaur matter everyth els peripher even plot get island want anoth glimps rex anxiou discov raptor lurk first one sixth instal dinosaur releg commerci product seen everi tv screen movi demot human genet even mutat locust term import two half hour movi one would expect dinosaur fill almost half time yet pale screen time comparison human charact instead director tri insert cameo legaci charact forc interact honestli cringey dialogu shift focu away real mean jurass park franchis awe dinosaur wonder gone given six star respect franchis limit appear favorit dinosaur sad see director forgot made jurass park special first place,1,0

316,316,Viking Wolf,Dog Bite,5,"I can see how some reviews comparing the film to a cluster of other horror films with bits and pieces sawn up together to make up the ""Vikinggulven"". Some may disagree but, I personally think that having been inspired by other films is not the problem until it becomes imitational. And it is not what happened in this film.Although the subject matter- werewolf is beaten to death through the past 5 decades, almost all possible ploys are consumed and endings feel like regurgitations of the same. Take for example a similar topic of zombies. The 1st zombie movie that has ever been made believed to be directed by Victor Halperin named ""White Zombie"" in 1936. However, the worldwide introduction of this particular spectacle is achieved by the director George A. Romero with the release of ""Night of the Living Dead"" in 1968. Since then according to Wikipedia, over 570 zombie-themed movies were released by the end of 2021.Accordingly, motion pictures that are made with the same brand of themes are similar in architecture, ambiance, character design, dialogs, and monologs as well as spaces (cities or small towns, forests or underground places, etc)Nonetheless, it is not unexpected for viewers to find similarities in this film and the others when a topic is so exhaustingly used up. However, the acting is ok, directing good, the writing is standard and CGI is good for a small-budget film. However, it's predictable, forgettable yet watchable.My suggestions for the writers and directors as well as wannabes create a new object and objective. Give it a few similar yet quite unfamiliar traits. Use your imagination. Don't give people what they want.

313,313,Viking Wolf,Was worth watching...,5,"I start out by saying that I like watching movies from other countries as they often have actors and filming locations that I've never seen. It does make it harder to evaluate the acting as you don't know if something you don't like is bad acting, bad direction or more a reflection of the culture the actor comes from. I say that as I liked the movie but found most of the characters subdued and not very friendly at any time in the movie. So I'd want more character and emotions but that might not be a Norwegian trait.The movie does derive from other werewolf movies but I still found parts of it fresh. I thought the modern approach to werewolves was better then most of what I've seen lately.There are plot holes as with any movie but I didn't really notice many until it was over. Although the crashing RV seemed out of the blue. And how do citizens get to crime scenes faster than other police?I like the ending, not only for its potential, or not, twist but also had the feeling that the police officer/mother was coming home to an empty house.Not a movie that you'll likely watch again in the near future but worth a watch now.",start say like watch movi countri often actor film locat never seen make harder evalu act know someth like bad act bad direct reflect cultur actor come say like movi found charact subdu friendli time movi want charact emot might norwegian trait movi deriv werewolf movi still found part fresh thought modern approach werewolv better seen late plot hole movi realli notic mani although crash rv seem blue citizen get crime scene faster polic like end potenti twist also feel polic offic mother come home empti hous movi like watch near futur worth watch,0,0

332,332,Blood,Michelle Monaghan in one the most disturbing film ever,4,"I loved THE MACHINIST but was mixed by BLOOD. The film has great elements, first Michelle Monaghan is phenomenal and her performance is really great, engaging as a mother who is ready to literally everything to support and heal his child. Also the two children are every great. The script is far from being flawless, but is full of suspense, tension and strong relationships between the characters.BLOOD is also one of the most disturbing film you'll ever see. It can be disgusting at moments, though there is no gore (but lots of, well, blood, in this film. What's unhealthy, and really disturbing is the character's decisions and actions, and Monaghan's character, just like us, knows from the very beginning that what she's doing is wrong. She can be seen as a mother who loves and cherishes her child, and also, as someone says in the movie, ""a monster"". That's really disturbing. And her actions become unbelievable at some points. Of course, the supernatural element here is only a pretext to think about: ""how far would you fo for your child?"".Still, there is a feeling that something is unfinished here, probably due due to some unanswered questions, but we feel it goes beyond these.BLOOD is a film you'll love or hate. What's sure is that you'll probably feel very uncomfortable, and be shocked watching this film. Whatever you'll like or hate it, you won't forget it, and you'll probably need to walk 20/30 minutes to absorb the experience.",love machinist mix blood film great element first michel monaghan phenomen perform realli great engag mother readi liter everyth support heal child also two children everi great script far flawless full suspens tension strong relationship charact blood also one disturb film ever see disgust moment though gore lot well blood film unhealthi realli disturb charact decis action monaghan charact like us know begin wrong seen mother love cherish child also someon say movi monster realli disturb action becom unbeliev point cours supernatur element pretext think far would fo child still feel someth unfinish probabl due due unansw question feel goe beyond blood film love hate sure probabl feel uncomfort shock watch film whatev like hate forget probabl need walk minut absorb experi,0,1

There's no point in me doing a synopsis, because if for some sick reason you've ever dreamed of a movie where Winnie the Pooh (yes, the bear from your childhood) goes psychotic and on a killing spree, that's just what you're going to get in this movie.I want to clarify something, being objective this is not a good movie even remotely. As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.So why do I give it a 7? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.In short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all. If you don't find the idea of Winnie the Pooh killing people at least a bit fun, you should do well by skipping this one.",case movi see poster good glimps go watch point synopsi sick reason ever dream movi winni pooh ye bear childhood goe psychot kill spree go get movi want clarifi someth object good movi even remot far slasher concern quit mediocr although brutal death end overshadow film terrifi give plot although quit stupid funni time see fat bear tortur kill victim someth worth see even curios funniest thing movi comedi might seem like take serious make fun also must say piglet squeal give film plu short best way watch movi understand one bad good movi take serious find idea winni pooh kill peopl least bit fun well skip one,1,0
230,230,Plane,Great 90s throwback,8,"The CG isn't convincing but that can't stop Plane from being a great 90s throwback that knows exactly how to execute all the expected genre tropes in fun and satisfying fashion and further proves that leading man Gerard Butler is the current king of B movies.Butler himself gives a terrific lead performance, charming and confident with the ability to humanise his leading man in a few scenes that linger on the shock and horror at the situation. Mike Colter is great with a deliberately closed off performance that makes him hard to read in a way that increases the tension.Together the two of them make for a likeable duo and don't overdo it with the rapport. Also worthy of mention is Tony Goldwyn whose character may be one note but he elevates the role so much and rescues his scenes out of their mundane nature.Jean-François Richet's direction is so good, the camera is constantly mobile and most importantly always comprehensible with a standout one take early on that kicks things off beautifully. The music by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp is so overly dramatic and that's exactly why it works.The pacing is basically perfect as well, at a tight 107 mins it doesn't even come close to over staying it's welcome, taking just the right amount of time to set everything up and build up to the crash and once they're on the island it just goes and does not let up.",cg convinc stop plane great throwback know exactli execut expect genr trope fun satisfi fashion prove lead man gerard butler current king b movi butler give terrif lead perform charm confid abil humanis lead man scene linger shock horror situat mike colter great deliber close perform make hard read way increas tension togeth two make likeabl duo overdo rapport also worthi mention toni goldwyn whose charact may one note elev role much rescu scene mundan natur jean fran oi richet direct good camera constantli mobil importantli alway comprehens standout one take earli kick thing beauti music marco beltrami marcu trumpp overli dramat exactli work pace basic perfect well tight min even come close stay welcom take right amount time set everyth build crash island goe let,1,1

197,197,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Lost Potential,2,"This film had great potential to be a great film, featuring well know and beloved characters as evil villains as opposed to be sweet and harmless. The concept and the idea of it was great! Of what happens after Christopher leaves his friends for college and doesn't return for so long. But the execution of this concept was a complete disappointment.The start of the movie was promising, with eerie, 2D animation in black and white like children's drawings depicting the past of Christopher discovering the famous characters and what they did when he left, but it immediately went downhill from there within the first ten minutes of the film.The acting was poor by a majority of the actors, but it didn't help either that their written dialogue was also so empty, flat and lazy. Absolutely none of the characters were well developed enough to like, even in the slightest bit.The animated blood and gore was exciting and promising for a thriller, aiming to invoke disgust and unease, but the way in which it had been animated was done so poorly that online content creators could do better. It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't good either.The number of inconsistencies constantly left me confused throughout the movie, wondering and questioning why characters were behaving in certain ways when it made no sense, or where things suddenly came from, everything felt like such a let down.Halfway through the movie, I had posted the thought to my friend I was watching it with that perhaps this film was attempting to be a satire but was just bad at it, and they looked it up to find that this movie genuinely was a serious attempt at a thriller movie.There is simply too much done poorly for this movie that it outshines its very, VERY few positive parts. It was genuinely such a disappointment I wanted to walk out in the first ten minutes.If you watch this as a satire and don't take it serious, you'll be able to get a good lot of laughs from it. I know I did. But as a serious thriller movie, it just didn't turn out well.The idea and concept of the movie was great. With it, a hilarious satire movie could've been made, or a genuinely disturbing and bone chilling horror could've been done.

15,15,Avatar: The Way of Water,How does a script get ignored for 13 years?,4,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

337,337,Blood,I didn't like it.,4,"Too many things wrong with this film. The film never reveals the secrets of the tree. Jess, as. Helen said, is a total monster. She is a bigger monster than what her son has become. She has a drug problem, ruined her marriage, neglects her children and takes her kids away from the other parent that is capable of providing care for them. Despite this, she is given custody of her two children because she is the mother.When her son becomes sick with an unexplained illness that turns him into a vampire like creature after he is bitten by the infected family pet, she hides his illness from the doctors in the hospital she works in. Out of her own selfishness and ego , she decides to feed her child human blood which she knows is unsustainable. At first, she illegally obtains the blood from the hospital's freezer that stores blood for patients, then animal blood from rabbits she purchased at a pet store, she feeds her son her own blood until that also isn't sustainable, then she kidnaps a terminally ill elderly woman who only has 6 months to live from an undisclosed cancer. She robs the poor elderly woman from her few days of life to satisfy her motherly ego by drawing her blood to feed her son.. She knows this will eventually end with the death of the old woman and she traumatizes her daughter with her decisions. Her son dies anyway but with a ton of collateral damage in her wake. Again, Helen said it best, Jes is a monster. The boy might have lived if given proper medical care.The flick is a vampire film without the ""vampire"". It reminded me a little of ""Let the Right One In (2008)"" in which in that film, a caretaker for the vampire kills and brings back blood for a young-looking girl that is hundreds of year-old vampire. But again, here, the film doesn't go into vampire lore. But it's the same concept of feeding a blood thirsty monster.I didn't like the film because I found the character, Jess, reprehensible and the story wasn't fleshed out well. The story of the tree is never revealed so we are left with nothing. The ending seems to imply or leave room for a possible sequel when the story seems to repeat itself with a new family pet that is at the brink of becoming infected. But this time the three has been burnt down. I really hope there isn't a sequel. This film was a waste of time. It felt like it would be a good film. Almost felt like an A24 horror in the beginning.

212,212,True Spirit,A Perky but Limited Telling of a Historic Journey,7,"A biographical movie about Jessica Watson, who became the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the world alone in 2009. The film, which stars Teagan Croft and is directed by Sarah Spillane, details Watson's journey and the support she received from her family and manager.Despite criticism from the media and government officials, Watson persevered and completed her journey, overcoming multiple storms and windless stasis. The film showcases the beautiful sailing sequences and pays homage to Watson's determination, making her a symbol of the ""can-do spirit.""However, the film has its flaws. The screenplay tends to disrupt the dramatic momentum, and the perky, clean-scrubbed tone makes the film feel like a Disney Channel movie. The film also oversimplifies the story, focusing solely on vindicating Watson and her family and coach, while ignoring the messiness of real life.Overall, ""True Spirit"" is a suitable movie for younger audiences, but for those looking for a more nuanced and thorough account of Watson's journey, her memoir and the 2010 documentary ""210 Days"" are recommended.",biograph movi jessica watson becam youngest sailor circumnavig world alon film star teagan croft direct sarah spillan detail watson journey support receiv famili manag despit critic media govern offici watson persev complet journey overcom multipl storm windless stasi film showcas beauti sail sequenc pay homag watson determin make symbol spirit howev film flaw screenplay tend disrupt dramat momentum perki clean scrub tone make film feel like disney channel movi film also oversimplifi stori focus sole vindic watson famili coach ignor messi real life overal true spirit suitabl movi younger audienc look nuanc thorough account watson journey memoir documentari day recommend,1,0

385,385,Magic Mke,"Very Slow Comedy, but brings in Great Laughs and Performances,",7,"Magic Mike is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's an enjoyable movie that brings in many laughs, as well as terrific performances from the entire cast, the chemistry between everyone is great, particularly the parts between Channing Tatum and Cody Horn, they both seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company and their scenes were very natural. It's a really slow movie and can admittedly get very boring at times, there are a lot of very lengthy scenes were the characters are literally just talking, while they are well acted and serve as a great method for character development, they can still get very tedious, they could have easily trimmed a lot of scenes and made it a more bearable ninety minute run. The highlight of the movie is definitely Matthew McConaughey, playing a character unlike one he has ever played before, he is very natural and charismatic in the role of Dallas, his scenes certainly had me entertained the most. It may be very slow, but Magic Milke is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, easy to watch, comedy if you ever see it on television and had some time to kill.

23,23,Avatar: The Way of Water,Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel.

17,17,Avatar: The Way of Water,One of the most visually innovative films ever,9,"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d.

60,60,Babylon,"A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema",8,"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10.",babylon track career manni torr aspir filmmak mexico cross path fellow aspir starlet nelli laroy bacchanalian parti one night lo angel film also follow sever charact parti includ movi star jack conrad cabaret perform fay zhu tabloid journalist elinor st john musician sidney palmer rise fall respect career span end silent film begin sound product charact cross path throughout navig shift busi hollywood larg scale epic damien chazel word ambiti scope mere technic open utterli ravish debaucher parti sequenc captur madden spirit roar twenti hollywood set visual bar fairli high number fantast sequenc throughout film key parti sequenc charact introduc first interven without doubt highlight film charact fiction screenplay blend pass name real life histor hollywood figur well thinli veil refer other firstli almost goe without say babylon gorgeous photograph perform also uniformli solid diego calva likabl presenc centerpiec charact margot robbi portray brash troubl jersey girl fli seat pant comic poignant turn brad pitt fittingli play drunken goodheart movi star jean smart also welcom presenc curt astut gossip columnist ostens base louella parson writer ilk film conscious top mani point captur madcap spirit someth late ken russel would direct first three quarter particularli outstand demonstr realiti technic transit silent film motion pictur talki pose legitim career alter often career destroy challeng nearli everyon part busi chazel project theme audienc one memor protract sequenc robbi charact along sound man struggl fail interrupt struggl perform simpl one page scene nut bolt logist challeng fledgl industri perhap intrigu compon stori highlight vastli differ arduou process make sound pictur actor filmmak accustom establish way time reach final act howev viewer get sens project begin implod weight degre focu certain charact ebb flow film begin lose steam reviv somewhat insan sequenc torr anoth crew member film studio attempt save laroy reckless gambl decis cross path eccentr crime boss play tobey maguir journey subterranean gather place citi debaucher denizen liter gone underground follow reserv moral code garish ghoulish sequenc feel like tour dant inferno probabl quit intent almost madcap open parti sequenc film grind somewhat abrupt halt charact live career face signific devast last thirti minut sens tragedi one might expect feel strang absent perhap charact larger life even cartoonish time still felt emot core miss stori resolv film end profoundli cynic note show hollywood place metaphor devour constantli replenish unend stream make pilgrimag seek etch mark tapestri cinema observ astut implic splash across screen centuri span montag snippet earliest film contemporari one babylon mani strong point mainli visual sturdi perform focu industri realiti earli filmmak st centuri viewer would take grant eventu grow bit long tooth third hour lose tenac enough film entir collaps though come close noth els earn keep ambiti scabrou love hate letter cinema,1,1

Josh Duhamel and Jennifer definitely had the chemistry going in this film.Basically the film is about a couple (Jennifer and Josh's characters) who are tying the knot on a beautiful island in Asia, paid for by themselves, because he doesn't want her stinking rich father to pay for it.The resort, though beautiful is cheap.. maybe because it is prone to pirate attacks. Something he fails to tell his perspective wife. There is a lot more to it, but I won't add spoilers, sit back and enjoy the ride yourself, you won't be disappointed.Yes, a lot is far fetched. But you don't watch this kind of film for realism, it is to escape and have a laugh.",realli enjoy thought go saw trailer shotgun wed knew straight away want watch love jennif cooligd love jlo actress will give go realli exceed expect smile way movi definit film watch want laugh jennif lopez hold screen josh duhamel jennif definit chemistri go film basic film coupl jennif josh charact tie knot beauti island asia paid want stink rich father pay resort though beauti cheap mayb prone pirat attack someth fail tell perspect wife lot add spoiler sit back enjoy ride disappoint ye lot far fetch watch kind film realism escap laugh,1,1

The flight should have been full. There were lots of errors in predeparture and the comms with the tower when they taxi for take off. And no other planes? The set up was easy to see, prisoner being transported, bad storm and then we're off.This had all the hall marks of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and any other action film you can think of from the 80s. After all the dross coming out of Hollywood why not just bring a film out to do one thing and that's entertain. And that's what it did. No woke (and that's a word I hate) message, no easily identified alphabet people (because it didn't matter). Just an action film, a hero and the usual tropes to propel it along. Believability played no part as it didn't in Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando or Rambo (and any subsequent parts). Just a hero, a dubious helper (the prisoner, who's part was never explained but had skills) , a hapless bunch of passengers and some native evil doers with guns. Let the popcorn flow.I wish they had done more with the passengers, they turned out to be just there and will not be remembered. They certainly could have amped it up more and taken the 80s action higher but it was a good time waster and I felt no need to think beyond what was shown.

The plane has no way to communicate its position and things become a survival game just for a short while.Not abusing spectators patience.

They knew they were making a Winnie the Pooh slasher and they leaned hard into the premise. I laughed, I was shocked (the deaths are all super fun and creative), and I was impressed by the cinematography and music (especially for this budget which I think is probably less than $100k).

Most 90s action movies are pretty bad by today's standards, but I don't mind going back to the feel of those movies, modernized and updated to the latest action standards. Plane does this fairly successfully, yet still falters when it comes to making a good overall movie.The action itself is pretty good for the most part, although there isn't much of it. There's a pretty tense scene early on, a gritty fight scene I really enjoyed, and a mediocre finale sequence. Three action scenes isn't enough for a nearly 2 hour movie.Everything is surface level. There is no depth. It's filled with subplots but none of them are fleshed out even a little. And there is definitely some dumb stuff, like the worst customer service associate in movie history, or moronic side characters. There are a couple extra cheesy moments as well. I rolled my eyes multiple times.This review may seem very negative, but I did mostly enjoy this movie. It's more than serviceable. I just wish it was better, especially since I'm exactly the target demographic and am prone to liking dumb action movies. I hope we see more attempts at modernized 90s throwbacks, but done right.

The acting is good - Ana de Armas is great, in fact -, but this script is terrible. I mean, I can understand what the director tried to achieve with this. I get the goals - he wanted to show all the tragedies in her life and how that culminated in the way she was and she ended her life. But it is so focused on the same single note over and over again that it is tedious and, to be honest, gives you very few reasons to keep watching. We already knew this wouldn't be a happy portrayal of Marilyn, but lacks any kind of balance to be a good work. I have no doubts that this was a big part of who she was, but she was much more than that and this film refuses to acknowledge that even with almost 3 hours of runtime.Stupidly long for what it tries to say - that is clear with 15 minutes -, tiring and never an engaging piece.

104,104,Knock at the Cabin,Pretty good film but a shame about the ending,7,"In a world of sequels and IP M. Night Shyamalan continues to give us interesting and original stories. And he tends to get a lot of flack for them sadly. People want original content but then destroy it every time it comes along. It's no wonder we can't have nice things. 'Knock at the Cabin' isn't perfect, but it's certainly a fun ride.The film starts out as a mystery. We don't know what is going on and everything seems very strange and is not making a lot of sense. It's a good way to start a movie. Then we are let in on what is going on and things become particularly interesting. It's at this point that you simply must turn your brain off to logic to get through the rest of the film. Because much like a lot of religion it doesn't make a lick of sense.Where the film let me down was the ending. The book has such a thought-provoking and interesting ending. To get the movie made they were obviously told they would have to change that. It's very disappointing but it's sadly where we are in the world of film.

373,373,Skinamarink,"I get why some find it boring,",9,"But I did not.Yes, Kyle Edward Ball's audaciously odd directorial debut is about 25-30 minutes too long, edited in such a way that too many shots overstay their welcome.Yes, it is filmed in a manner to seemingly intentionally test an audience's patience with still shots that hide the characters' faces and set aside narrative momentum in favor of metaphorical experimentation.This will bother, and clearly has bothered, a lot of people. And I get it. It's not what they wanted. No hard feelings to these people. But now I want to talk about why I loved this film.I was absolutely gripped by Skinamarink. I found so much depth and meaning to come from its bare-bones visual and aural presentation.It's so, so ambiguous. But that didn't bother me because rather than showing bizarre imagery for the sake of it like so many experimental films, Ball instead keeps a GREAT deal of unknown in each frame.The creaky, eerie sound complimented the ever-shifting static of the cinematography to make my brain play all kinds of tricks on me. A handful of horrifying disturbing images make an appearance throughout the film, but the constant wondering of ""what was that sound"" or ""did I see something move in the frame"" made me just as on edge throughout.Though short on plot, I still found surprising thematic/character depth in each of the movie's unsettling, eerie frames of a single house.We don't get to know much about Kevin and Kaylee, but we know what kind of relationship they have as young siblings from the film's opening scenes, and it is so soul-crushing to see what happens and doesn't happen to them over the story's nightmarish happenings.As these kids are stalked in their house by something unknown and unseen, the horrifying things we see and hear are so clearly indicative of common childhood fears, traumas, and challenges: divorce, nightmares, abandonment, neglect, death, and a lack of control over your own choices.Seeing them play out on screen in such an uncanny way was so sad and so terrifying. The film's lack of a musical score, lack of concrete answers, piercing sound design, and ability to turn the intimacies of childhood into faceless, unknowable antagonists all made this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.",ye kyle edward ball audaci odd directori debut minut long edit way mani shot overstay welcom ye film manner seemingli intent test audienc patienc still shot hide charact face set asid narr momentum favor metaphor experiment bother clearli bother lot peopl get want hard feel peopl want talk love film absolut grip skinamarink found much depth mean come bare bone visual aural present ambigu bother rather show bizarr imageri sake like mani experiment film ball instead keep great deal unknown frame creaki eeri sound compliment ever shift static cinematographi make brain play kind trick hand horrifi disturb imag make appear throughout film constant wonder sound see someth move frame made edg throughout though short plot still found surpris themat charact depth movi unsettl eeri frame singl hous get know much kevin kayle know kind relationship young sibl film open scene soul crush see happen happen stori nightmarish happen kid stalk hous someth unknown unseen horrifi thing see hear clearli indic common childhood fear trauma challeng divorc nightmar abandon neglect death lack control choic see play screen uncanni way sad terrifi film lack music score lack concret answer pierc sound design abil turn intimaci childhood faceless unknow antagonist made one scariest movi ever seen,1,0

391,391,Magic Mke,Not the way real dancers are.,4,"I was a stripper. Yes, I was. I was fairly good too.This film however doesn't capture the reality behind the stage, on-stage or even the crowd.The reality is that the male dancers - or even female dancers aren't all friends...they are greedy, selfish ego tripping characters who look forward only to the dollars. They fight backstage, they get drunk back stage and they do serious amounts of coke back stage.Most male dancers are also gay. I am not and for that reason, the few men that are not gay will be reading ""picture books"" behind the curtain to ensure that they are ""up"" to the challenge when they are on stage.The gay men will be taking care of each other respectively before they go on stage.Most female crowds are mostly fat, overweight women who are nearing 50 and are there to get totally drunk. Male dancers will go to the table for them and pull everything off, but will not take them on-stage and perform nasty acts - clothed or unclothed.Also - we didn't have groups of 5 or 6 go up on-stage and perform a routine set. With people travelling all the time and new people coming in and out, we barely knew who each other was from a daily basis.Nobody fraternized with the bar-staff after closing...everybody was tired, stressed or too stoned to do anything. The bar-staff closed up and everybody got kicked out.If anybody tried to do a back-flip on-stage, they would have been fired or told not to do that again...because of liability and safety and insurance reasons.We made our money doing lap dances...not having a hundred girls throw money in our underwear on-stage.The back room dressing areas were always slightly better than a warehouse - filled with all sorts of bar crap...regardless of the bar or location.Anybody under the legal limit would never be allowed on-stage. There was always vice to make sure.There was always so much tension in the dressing room...because we were competing for the same money, that more than the mere basic communication between dancers never existed.This is a film based on the male stripper occupation, but misses out on the reality of it.It's also over drawn for plot.

102,102,Knock at the Cabin,"Knock, Knock at the Cabin. Who's There? Strangers Telling You It's the End of the World. No, Thank You, We Don't Want Any!",5,"Okay, Streamers, I know we all have been waiting on pins and needles for M. Night Shyamalan's next feature film, and it's finally here. Oh, was that only me? Okay, then... Anway, I was anticipating Knock at the Cabin since I saw the first trailer last fall. Home invasion and the end of the world movies build on reasonable fears that many people have, so let's see what Shyamalan was able to do with the mix of these two.Knock at the Cabin is based on a novel by Paul Tremblay, ""The Cabin at the End of the World."" Shyamalan and his co-writers have adapted that novel into this movie. The basic premise is that a gay couple and their adopted daughter are on a vacation in a remote cabin in Pennsylvania when four strangers come to the cabin and tell them that the world will end unless they decide to sacrifice one of their own. It's a moral dilemma - kill someone you love in order to save billions of people you don't even know. What would you do if these hijinks ensue.Here's the thing - the premise of this movie is very interesting. It immediately makes the audience question what decision they would make and what questions they would ask if put in this situation. In that way, the movie easily grabs you. The problem is that Shyamalan doesn't do much more than pose the question and go through the motions of telling you what these guys do. It gets repetitive and there isn't enough development of the gay couple as characters to help the audience care about them or why they make the decisions they make. Therefore, the movie becomes pretty frustrating and unsatisfying.On the other hand, there are some good aspects. Dave Bautista, who plays one of the strangers, Leonard, is an inviting presence on screen. He can be menacing by his sheer size, but his performance ably fights against first impressions. Rupert Grint, who play another stranger, Redmond, brings a bit of dark humor. He's probably the scariest of the strangers. I'll also mention that even though I don't believe they are well-developed characters, Ben Aldridge and Jonathan Groff, who play the gay couple, Eric and Andrew, have good chemistry and react appropriately in this situation. I'll also say that no one does anything really dumb in this movie, which typically happens in these home invasion movies. Eric and Andrew, generally, make smart decisions to help protect each other and their daughter. So, the movie isn't frustrating because anyone is dumb.I also don't know why this movie is rated R. There isn't really any gore. There isn't anything visually scary about it. There may be some curse words, but I can't imagine they were enough to justify this not being PG-13.In conclusion, Knock at the Cabin is a decent entry in the Shyamalan filmography. It is not one of his best, but it also certainly not one of the worst. There is a good premise, but the movie doesn't do anything more than present it as a morality play, which eventually becomes repetitive. Although there are good performances, there isn't enough character development to sustain interest in these individuals. Knock at the Cabin is only good enough for a handful of popcorn - there's no urgency to see this in a theater.",okay streamer know wait pin needl night shyamalan next featur film final oh okay anway anticip knock cabin sinc saw first trailer last fall home invas end world movi build reason fear mani peopl let see shyamalan abl mix two knock cabin base novel paul tremblay cabin end world shyamalan co writer adapt novel movi basic premis gay coupl adopt daughter vacat remot cabin pennsylvania four stranger come cabin tell world end unless decid sacrific one moral dilemma kill someon love order save billion peopl even know would hijink ensu thing premis movi interest immedi make audienc question decis would make question would ask put situat way movi easili grab problem shyamalan much pose question go motion tell guy get repetit enough develop gay coupl charact help audienc care make decis make therefor movi becom pretti frustrat unsatisfi hand good aspect dave bautista play one stranger leonard invit presenc screen menac sheer size perform abli fight first impress rupert grint play anoth stranger redmond bring bit dark humor probabl scariest stranger also mention even though believ well develop charact ben aldridg jonathan groff play gay coupl eric andrew good chemistri react appropri situat also say one anyth realli dumb movi typic happen home invas movi eric andrew gener make smart decis help protect daughter movi frustrat anyon dumb also know movi rate r realli gore anyth visual scari may curs word imagin enough justifi pg conclus knock cabin decent entri shyamalan filmographi one best also certainli one worst good premis movi anyth present moral play eventu becom repetit although good perform enough charact develop sustain interest individu knock cabin good enough hand popcorn urgenc see theater,0,1

Since there was nothing else on, and I was tired from the workweek, I did. When Jesse Williams (from Grey's Anatomy) showed up, I perked up because, well, it's Jesse Williams! The movie did start to move a little faster then. Faster but not better.There's no real tension in the movie until the last scene, which feels tacked on just so there can be a climactic ""I hate you, no - I love you!"" scene. Everyone gets what they want effortlessly. Want a top NYC editor to read your friend's book? Both he and his assistant read it overnight and of course, want to publish it. Debbie/Reese is taking a graduate class but never has to study. Want your friend's kid to be on the hockey team? Even though his mom hasn't let him play hockey, he makes it on the first try.It's a lot of telling, not showing. We're told they've had this 20 year best friendship, but we don't see anything that would lead us to think that. We're told they fell in love the first night, but we don't see it.I think because I already have good will towards Reese and Ashton, I automatically root for them from the top to the extent that I care, which isn't much.Zoe Chao is the one really funny character, but that may be more the actor than the writing. I was happy to see Steve Zahn but then his character was just dumb. The young actor playing Jack was very good. I didn't like it, though, when Jack was given preternatural insight for his age.There's no actual comedy, except for Zoe Chao. Maybe if the writer had rewritten it a bunch of times and made the dialogue better. I can't remember one line standing out or making me laugh.I know the writer can do much better, given she also wrote ""Devil Wears Prada.""",first realli realli like devil wear prada watch repeatedli writer place facil lazi write first hour kept debat whether stick sinc noth els tire workweek jess william grey anatomi show perk well jess william movi start move littl faster faster better real tension movi last scene feel tack climact hate love scene everyon get want effortlessli want top nyc editor read friend book assist read overnight cours want publish debbi rees take graduat class never studi want friend kid hockey team even though mom let play hockey make first tri lot tell show told year best friendship see anyth would lead us think told fell love first night see think alreadi good toward rees ashton automat root top extent care much zoe chao one realli funni charact may actor write happi see steve zahn charact dumb young actor play jack good like though jack given preternatur insight age actual comedi except zoe chao mayb writer rewritten bunch time made dialogu better rememb one line stand make laugh know writer much better given also wrote devil wear prada,0,0
62,62,Babylon,Decadence,7,"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.",babylon long messi repuls magnet spectacl unfortun despit great perform set piec live chazel previou work movi want bring wast yard hollywood pull see beauti grow trash problem movi spend much time mud goe deep time tri pull end late upsid cast great almost complet carri movi especi margot robbi enthral perform nelli chazel previou work set piec well execut charact memor howev posit could complet overcom movi fundament flaw go far tri revolt audienc point childish spend enough time charact import scene despit decad runtim end come complet pretenti context practic cynic everyth lead end babylon serv purpos entertain spectacl like hollywood critiqu self indulg prevent achiev great,1,0
310,310,Viking Wolf,Damn those Vikings!,4,"The title Viking Wolf basically reveals everything you need to know about this movie. Greedy vikings back in the day released a hound from hell which made it's way into the Nordic woods. Cut to the present time, it continues to wreck havoc by attacking annoying teenagers. Barring the initial hype created with the Vikings scene, the story follows the routine narrative wrt werewolf movies. A family which has newly moved into the small town and the rebellious teen daughter being her annoying best to be rude to her mom and new step dad. There's a deaf sister too who for the plot's sake only becomes relevant in the final act and ofcourse the mother is a cop.Netflix got me intrigued enough to watch this one due to the trending. Anyways it was indeed a predictable age old werewolf movie, just that this one is Norwegian. There were several convenient plot points throughout cutting the tension. It is less gory too compared to other similar films. What I did enjoy was the final act especially the scene on the bus which is why I am going with a lenient rating. If they had explored more of the daughter's character and her equation with her mother then the end result could have been better. Unfortunately the characterization was just not effective enough to root for both the main characters.",titl vike wolf basic reveal everyth need know movi greedi vike back day releas hound hell made way nordic wood cut present time continu wreck havoc attack annoy teenag bar initi hype creat vike scene stori follow routin narr wrt werewolf movi famili newli move small town rebelli teen daughter annoy best rude mom new step dad deaf sister plot sake becom relev final act ofcours mother cop netflix got intrigu enough watch one due trend anyway inde predict age old werewolf movi one norwegian sever conveni plot point throughout cut tension less gori compar similar film enjoy final act especi scene bu go lenient rate explor daughter charact equat mother end result could better unfortun character effect enough root main charact,0,0
