0,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Visuals Top, Movie Not",6,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No."
1,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning and action packed but story is light,7,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale."
2,Avatar: The Way of Water,Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.,6,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is."
3,Avatar: The Way of Water,I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one,4,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?"
4,Avatar: The Way of Water,Empty beauty,5,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise."
5,Avatar: The Way of Water,James Cameron's triumphant return,9,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while."
6,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is",6,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have."
7,Avatar: The Way of Water,Pretty visuals dont make a good movie. This movie only has got one gear and it bored the heck out of me!,4,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!"
8,Avatar: The Way of Water,"A beautiful highly entertaining movie, but a bit cheesy and cliche",7,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so..."
9,Avatar: The Way of Water,Most part felt like watching a sequence from National Geographic,6,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class..."
10,Avatar: The Way of Water,Damn James Cameron...,9,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man."
11,Avatar: The Way of Water,Visually stunning but very weak characters and story,5,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable."
12,Avatar: The Way of Water,Story and especially the dialogue is awful.,3,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes."
13,Avatar: The Way of Water,During Cameron's VFX gloating...he forgot to throw in a story..,3,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.
14,Avatar: The Way of Water,"I Don't care. I just don't. This was beautiful, and an absolute experience in 3D imax.",10,"Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE."
15,Avatar: The Way of Water,How does a script get ignored for 13 years?,4,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading."
16,Avatar: The Way of Water,Tiresome,3,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.
17,Avatar: The Way of Water,One of the most visually innovative films ever,9,"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking."
18,Avatar: The Way of Water,A movie worth going to see at the cinema,9,"The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)"
19,Avatar: The Way of Water,3 hours of what...,4,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer..."
20,Avatar: The Way of Water,Reminded Me of Star Wars Episode 2 :(,5,"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda."
21,Avatar: The Way of Water,"Dangerously close to a turkey, or maybe it's a tolkun",5,"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10."
22,Avatar: The Way of Water,Extraordinary boring ZzZzZzZ,1,"What the f did I just watch? Avatar 2 is probably one of the most boring movies you will ever see. There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise."
23,Avatar: The Way of Water,Waste of money and time. Can't believe Cameron took 13 years to make this garbage,3,"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks)."
24,Avatar: The Way of Water,"More Avatar, More Water, More Average",6,"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10."
25,The Menu,"A completely bonkers and over-the-top, yet perhaps brilliant satire",8,"This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.I won't spoil anything with a synopsis, but rather try to intrigue anyone on the fence about seeing this movie.The Menu has something fresh and interesting to say about the tired conversation surrounding the marriage between art and artist. There are some very clearly illogical and confusing elements of the plot that you can easily miss if you're taking it at face value.Overall, this movie isn't meant to be a sensible, coherent and satisfying thriller. Instead, it's a comment on a poignant phenomenon in our society: the way we view, consume, pursue, and ultimately obsess over those who produce the art around us. Sure, the movie is about a chef and his meticulous menu, but in reality the larger point is about the production of any type of art, namely filmmaking.It seems to me that the filmmaker is making a very focused point about the state of movies nowadays. There seems to be a constant theme throughout about how often artist and their fans seem so detached from each other, even though their mutual approval of the art should be enough to bring them together.An absolutely bonkers second act and a considerably more bonkers third act wrap up what I believe to be a masterpiece commentary on the state of filmmaking in 2022. The only moneymakers are massive superhero movies, massive studio A++ list celebrity movies, etc, and the makers of this film ask one simple question:How long until we collectively call out their BS and ask for some simple bread?The movie makes you question how far you'd go into ""buying into the hype"", and conversely has a quite shocking commentary on those who consistently stay away from ""the hype"" without buying into it. Think of some of the ridiculous fashion trends that some of the highest brands in clothing perpetuate, and just how many people will blindly follow simply because there is an LV or GG stamp on it.It's no shock to me that a script with this kind of tonal shifting comes to us from the writers/directors of Succession. So much of the way this film is crafted reminds me of the show. Sharp wit, sarcasm that lies somewhere between funny and cringeworthy, twists, turns, and of course, the oh-so subtle thumbing of the nose at all the socially accepted, yet fundamentally insane reverence for brilliance that we hold dear.As a movie-lover, this was one of the more thought provoking pieces of the year. This movie makes you wonder what the line is between brilliant artist and insane psycho. The movie makes you look around and find yourself in the all the characters; the artist, the art, and those who are (literally) consuming it.All in all, this movie is an insightful parody of the state of not only the word of fine dining, but also fashion, art, filmmaking, music, etc. I might have a completely wrong reading of this movie, but hey, that's what art's about, right?"
26,The Menu,A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today,10,"From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger. As the chef pointed out, they didn't try hard enough to fight back. It was as if they all had already accepted the menu. In the final scene, you can see some of them even thanking chef.Though some of them tried to escape, they didn't fight back. Margot fought back, against the menu, by sending it back and being authentic with herself and then with the chef."
27,The Menu,The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.,5,"The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry."
28,The Menu,One of the most unique theater going experiences I've had in a long time,8,"This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.What set this film apart from other thriller, horrors are great performances and great writing. Every character here is well done and intelligently written. The entire cast gives great performances with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy truly being the standouts as they playoff each other very well.Each character purposely reflected a personality type that if you ever worked in service you would encounter and come to know very well. To my fellow service employees you know what I'm talking about.What really stuck with me long after the credits have rolled is the commentary this film has on society. At it's core I believe this film to be about a Chef who's long career facing multitudes of people both customers and critics has affected his passion for his art. It's here where I also believe to be the film makers commentary on what it is to be an artist in this films case a Chef. It felt to me what the film makers are saying is as artists they pour their heart and souls into their art and craft both to serve and entertain us and as consumers it's very easy to lose appreciation for that hard work and effort.But I digress, perhaps I'm over thinking things and this film is not very deep as I seem to believe it is. Nonetheless this film was quite unique, thrilling, and entertaining. It's films like these that remind me of why I go to the theater and why I fell in love with storytelling and cinema.IMDb: 8/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters."
29,The Menu,"Nice Try, But the Satire Doesn't Land",6,"Nice try, but the satire doesn't land in this film that skewers pretentious foodies and the chefs who cook for them.There's already been one satire this year that savages the rich, ""Triangle of Sadness,"" and that's a much better film than this one. I'm ok with an outlandish premise, but if you're going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they're in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next. The tone doesn't stick to one or the other, so what was probably intended to be cutting instead falls flat.The ending especially is silly. It definitely did not leave me wanting s'more.Grade: C+"
30,The Menu,🍲The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution 🍛,6,"And that's all Folks, that's all you need to Know. The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution of the Movie.Things I Did Like -1. The First Half Was Really Good, Nice Chilled out Mellow Mood with a Hint of Something Sinister Going on was Weaved Within the First Half.2. The Description and Pictures of the Different Dishes on screen was Great to See.3. The Anya Taylor Joy Character Reveal whilst talking to the Chef was Ok I guess.4. The Cop or Security Guy that Shows Up to Help was a Good Scene.5. I liked the Fact that the Chef Knew Exactly who everyone was and their History. Also, in the first half, he had this Charming yet Mysterious Malicious Vibe about him. That was Excellent.Problems I Have with the Movie -1. I get the Motivation for why the Chef is Doing what he is Doing to these People but it wasn't Executed with any Interest in these Characters.2. After the First Half, the Mood changed because the Characters Sort of Knew where this was heading and I didn't like that tone whatsoever, it was kind of like seriousness with a joky overtone and it didn't work for me.3. Two People do Something to themselves because of the there own Self-Disappointment and Supposed Admiration for the Chef and I thought to myself ""Really?""4. There is a pointless albeit a sort of funny to watch ""Activity"" that happens in the Movie. But it was Pointless.5. At the End, When Anya Taylor Joy gives the Chef a ""Change of Heart"", I thought it was a great idea however once again, it wasn't Executed profoundly, it was Dull.6. The Final, Final end Bit, some of the Characters actually start Believing what this Chef is saying and agreeing with him, ""Like Really?""Overall, The Premise was Far Better than the Execution."
31,The Menu,Great satire,8,"The Menu isn't the first to satirise the rich and their incompetence and isn't saying anything new but that definitely doesn't prevent it from being a great satire that pokes fun at everything it can in ways that are often consistently funny, playful and extremely stylish.Ralph Fiennes gives a terrific performance full of awkward unease that only enhances his commanding screen presence. Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect audience surrogate amongst a sea of deliberately unlikeable characters of which the best is Nicholas Hoult whose almost too good at making his character hilariously pathetic.Mark Mylod's direction is excellent, the film has more than enough visual style to match the pretentiousness of its characters and is really good at building tension. The music by Colin Stetson is fantastic, striking a unusual balance between beautiful and unnerving."
32,The Menu,"Original, but ultimately unsatisfying fare.",6,"I waited months for this film thinking it would be so much better than it was. There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.While the plot is pretty original (which normally scores high points with me) and while the film is at times quite beautiful to look at, it altogether missed the main point of a good meal: gratification.Scares are not included on the menu; comedic value is barely there; it is unsatisfyingly light on gore; hints of interesting dialogue exist, but they are scantily peppered throughout; the characters as well as their backstories, are as distinctly unpalatable, as are their intentions nondescript; it wore on and became progressively less, instead of more enjoyable; and the main course was both 'cheesy' and less than fulfilling. By the time dessert was to be served, the previous dishes laid still undigested and leaden.I'd like to speak to the manager, please."
33,The Menu,86 it!,4,This looked like an interesting film based on the trailer and the first half of it was just that. The tension and suspense was building nicely. There were little dribs and drabs and hints of what might be coming without being too obvious. The acting from everyone in the film was good. Even supporting characters with only a few lines. Were well realized I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to see where it was all going.Sadly it didn't really go anywhere. It all unwound in the second half. The acting was still on but the writing failed. That's the most i can say without giving up any spoilers. And that was extra disappointing because the first half was so good. This Menu did not deliver the meal as advertised.
34,The Menu,I tried to chew but couldn't swallow,6,"""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end. ""The Menu"" could have given us something to chew on, instead I walk out of the movie theater scratching my head."
35,The Menu,A very tasty treat indeed!,8,"The Menu is a real treat. It will have you laughing while on the edge of your seat as it navigates you through a restaurant experience to remember.We are treated to a fantastic ensemble cast. Nicholas Hoult steals the show with a pitch perfect performance of a pretentious foodie. Fiennes is so wonderfully unhinged as the mysterious creator of the eponymous menu in a very layered role. Anya Taylor Joy as always is so watchable, providing such an easy way in for the audience. The writing gives them all such brilliant material which the whole cast executes with ease.The style and staging of the piece can't be faulted at all. It is precise, inventive, and so clean and polished which makes for a very visually appealing film.It must be said there are a few rough edges when it comes to the plot, and when you get down to the nuts and bolts the premise isn't necessarily groundbreaking. It is very on the nose at times and subtlety isn't exactly it's strong suit. However it manages to strike a well tuned balance between satire, comedy, and thriller which isn't an easy feat and is impressively managed here.With its sharp social observations and satire, clean style, and stellar performances, the Menu is a feast that you won't want to end."
36,The Menu,The Menu Lacks Flavor,3,"I saw all the glowing reviews for this movie, so I was expecting a winner. But this menu lacked flavor.Problems with this movie: Nobody you cared about; why did Chef decide to do this final menu; why did everyone believe in his cause; how were these people who came that 'bad' or deserving of their fate; why would he tell at least one of them what he was planning; and what was the point of setting up a fake coast guard, how did he know that would even be needed; what was the point of having his mother there; how does the protagonist not only figure out how to start up the boat but also pilot it in the dark.The movie had good pacing, but the direction this film was going, even who would survive in the end, was way too obvious early on. A shame that so many great actors were somewhat wasted in this film."
37,The Menu,One dumb film.,2,"If you are an avid film watcher and want your intelligence insulted by a story depicting a bunch decent actors playing very inept roles as guest to dine at a remote island restaurant hosted by a sadistic chef to then be massacre without fighting back at all, then have at it. I mean this was absolutely appalling to watch. You really want me to believe that I'm trapped on a island defenseless against a bunch of cooks? That there is no way to defend myself is anyway with a bunch of utensils all around? Seriously? That I'm so supposed to just accept my fate at the hand of dimwits based off a nonsensical menu to only become part of the menu? Really? And that's the story premise I kid you not. No matter many hype reviews have been posted, This was just one dumb film."
38,The Menu,A sumptuous feast for the eyes,9,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is a tasteful treat that manages to be gripping, satirical, jarring, and hauntingly brilliant. The film is a great social commentary on class values and class systems. It gives audiences an adrenaline rush that makes for an exciting and wild viewing experience. The film is filled with twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing till the credits roll. Apart from its rich screenplay and magnificent production design, the film also benefits from having a star-studded cast. Ralph Fiennes as the stern and conservative Chef Slovik is the obvious standout, but Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot aka Erin brings something different to the table (literally). Nicholas Hoult as Tyler perfectly brings this rather douchey and self-obsessed character to life. I went in completely blind, not having watched the trailer and avoided any marketing for the movie, and I'm glad that I did. Everyone should experience this movie by themselves and to not let anyone influence their opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie nabs Oscar nominations for best production design and best screenplay. Mark Mylod fully utilized his creative outlet and managed to craft something peculiar, unfamiliar, and delightful.Final verdict: 9.5/10."
39,The Menu,"Serve me something else, please.",3,"'The Menu' received widespread acclaim, and honestly I can't fathom why. The film is just as pretentious as gourmet cooking.So, twelve guests attend an executive, very, very expensive dinner on an island. All of them were personally invited by Chef Slowik. On arrival, the maître d'hôtel Elsa noticed Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) did not bring his original date. With him is Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) who - as it turns out - was hired to accompany him. This little detail will play a big part later.The rest of the film is set almost entirely in the restaurant, as we watch the specially selected menu being served - gourmet cooking at its best. Exquisite dishes are being served, impeccably garnished to perfection. (Personally, I've never been one for gourmet food. I want FOOD, not samples thereof...)We soon realize there is something sinister about the chef. This is one of those films where saying too much will result in spoilers. All I'm going to say, is that even after a person gets killed in view of everyone, they continue serving and the guest continue to saviour their food. And even towards the end they STILL have an appetite and comment on how delicious the food is - after everything that's happened...!!!! I shook my head in disbelief thinking ""what the bloody hell is wrong with these people..."".As the film developed, it became weirder and weirder. Just weird. There were a few character twists, but as a whole the movie just wasn't entertaining. Oh, and the Tyler character was a real idiot and the most unlikeable character. Very little to nothing is told why the victims deserved their fate. This film made absolutely no sense whatsoever.Despite all the fancy trimmings, by the end all I wanted was a plain ole cheese burger (figuratively speaking, off course). I wanted something with substance, and not merely hints of something promising (hmm, just like gourmet food...)Had 'The Menu' not been given a substantial budget with a stellar cast, this could easily have ended up being a bad B-movie. By the time the film ended, it felt like a complete waste of time for this highly overrated film. 'The Menu' did not satisfy my palette. I can't recommend this.Would I watch it again? No! I want a cheese burger...with fries."
40,The Menu,Absence Of A Single Likable Character (Or Over-Arching Message) May Limit The Palette Here,3,"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining"" is anything but.To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu"" was that it lacked any character I could really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I couldn't find a ""way in"".I also believe that ""The Menu"" is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to see what sticks"" sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.I can give ""The Menu"" 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly care one way or another."
41,The Menu,Just awful,2,"The 2 points are for the acting from some of the side characters and a couple of ""margos"" scenes.But the chef & about a boy man, were just awful. The ""storyline"" was just awful. No real understanding of why all these people suddenly decided to do a mass murder/suicide.Killing innocent (though annoying) people, after obviously being just good chefs. And then everyone just getting their credit cards out and then sitting there with marshmallows on their bodies, waiting to die.Get the h up and move. Just ridiculous. The attempts to escape were pathetic. Yeah they were out numbered but get up and fight, dont just accept it, you are going to die anyway, so try something, take someone out etc.And then the cheeseburger. Please."
42,The Menu,I'd Like To Take It Back,4,"So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.The film sees a young couple who travel to a Remote Island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the Chef has prepared a lavish & interesting menu. Though as soon as they arrive there, things are not all they seem & the food the Chef brings out makes the couple & everyone else question what is really going on as a sinister feeling starts to boil...!I found the film to be not the greatest. I mean, the first half is great & suspenseful & really keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It really entices you in as there doesn't appear to be anything to make you think something obviously bad is going to happen. So, for the first half it's great, but...The second half is a let down. The film goes completely off the rails, the story itself & its narrative are as clear as mud & there's so many unanswered questions, plot holes & things that happen that go against the main antagonists rules. The ending was just bad also & just plain lazy & too straight forward for a film like this one.The action we did get, the gore & shocking violence were great, but couldn't save this dish, sadly. There's some humour to be had in this film which was good, but again, couldn't salvage this feast even if it wanted to.The film does somewhat drag & the runtime is 100 minutes too long (1 hour & 40 minutes). I also felt the narrative & story arc of the film wasn't clear enough & the ending was totally unsatisfactory. The cast, however, were great. The characters were ok, but the main female lead was pretty unlikable. Chef Slowik was good though.Overall, it's a pretty out there film. Not the greatest & has a clear as mud plot with other elements not aiding in the understanding. The characters are ok, but weak with the except of Chef Slowik, the main antagonist Margo wasn't likable & pretty obnoxious. The films story arc & ending made no sense & had 0 explanation by the final act with a dragged out pacing & runtime. While there was some funny parts & some action/gore, it couldn't save this dish that I would like to take back.4/10."
43,The Menu,Pointless and empty,1,"Dark humor and satire are mostly very satisfying. But in The Menu it didn't go as well as it started. The beginning is actually very good. I was completely enchanted. The cinematography and acting is stunning. But somewhere in the middle something went very wrong. So wrong that you don't understand what's going on. And that's exactly where The Menu fails. Too many awkward and crazy things happen and no one seemed to care, and that's also when I realized that The Menu is actually a very pointless and empty dark satire with no real punchline. Only snobbish film critics will love this ""masterpiece"". Real people who prefer a cheeseburger to snobbish food will hate it. Giving it one star to offset the high rating the film doesn't deserve."
44,The Menu,Artsy and empty,3,"Zero point to the entire length of this artsy mess. A bunch of stars stuffed into a room on an island. No twist. No plot line. A bunch of lame recipes served as acts in a play.Summary: idiots stuck in room don't fight back eventually burn up as s'mores. Yep, s'mores. After we get to watch the lady actor with huge eyes pretend to devour a cheeseburger.I feel like this film was pitched to a room of people dosed with some heavy meds and then asked if they dig it or not. The room replied: I dig it.This is a stunt you'd typically see on Netflix. This somehow was approved without that checkbox.I have really nothing great to say about this. I guess I could comment it was shot well in some studio full of actors that need attention. If you're into that then waste your life like I did."
45,The Menu,"Original, intense, thought provoking, excellent.",9,"A group of people are invited to spend an evening with the renowned chef Chef Slowik at his Island restaurant, an uneasy, uncomfortable evening begins.Wow, one or the most original, creative and thought provoking films for quite a while, the most original movie of 2022. I wasn't sure quite what to expect, and even as the film progressed, I had no idea what it was going to develop into, and where it was heading, such was the originality.Terrific visuals, it was beautifully shot, very well filmed, I loved the symmetry and imagery, it looked great.Ralph Fiennes never disappoints, and he gave a masterclass here as Slowik, some wonderfully intense scenes, he commanded attention. Considering the number of Brits playing Americans, I had no issues with the accents, they all did a fine job, I really enjoyed watching Nicholas Hoult also.Proof that there is still originality in cinema, 9/10."
46,The Menu,I just don't get it - I guess?,3,"Maybe I'm just not snobby enough, or maybe I expect to be entertained when I pay the kind of money that movies cost today!! On both accounts, I feel totally ripped off!!!I suppose the message was making fun of rich/eccentric idiots? I don't know, someone is going to have to explain WTF I just saw. It was horrible! When I saw the trailer, I couldn't figure out how they'd make a 2 hour movie from simply eating dinner - my initial instincts were correct - YOU CAN'T!! With the exception of a few laughable scenes, overall it was painfully slow, boring and void of any interesting plot or characters. I would have walked out, if I hadn't agreed to go with a friend.RECOMMENDATION: Skip it! I'd rather watch paint dry...."
47,The Menu,After watching this I crave a cheeseburger!,9,"The Menu is probably the most unpredictable movie I've seen in a while. This thriller is filled tension and super dark comedy moments and it's wonderfully carried by the amazing, Anya-Taylor Joy, the charismatic, Nicholas Hoult, the menacing, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of the cast as well (one of the best ensembles in a film of the year). Overall, this is a brilliant satire on the food industry and class warfare. This film is (pun intended) chef's kiss!Also little tangent, Nicholas Hoult was up against Robert Pattinson for The Batman and after watching The Menu I really wish Nicholas gotten the part because he gave a lot of Bruce Wayne energy here."
48,The Menu,Appealing,7,"THE MENU is a good and unusual little thriller that proves a breath of fresh air in this day and age. One for the more jaded among us, it provides the kind of surprising, satirical modern-times scenario that I was hoping from GLASS ONION (and which didn't land). This one is variously a mystery, a comedy, a horror film and more besides, and it has depth and a careful skewering of a whole industry which I found more than satisfying. The cast is remarkable too, with each particular actor - from Fiennes to Hoult, Leguizamo to Taylor-Joy - carefully chosen to fit the perfect role for their talents. Appealing!"
49,Babylon,Excess is the name of the game,8,"Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood."
50,Babylon,Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse,8,"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out."
51,Babylon,At least an hour too long.,6,"This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance. The all star stellar cast were all amazing, especially Margot Robbie - who was the only reason I didn't stop watching 40+ mins into this utter disastrous nonsense. The critics got this one right. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, all going to the performances and decent cinematography."
52,Babylon,Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie,4,"So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like. This movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is."
53,Babylon,"Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless!",4,"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5."
54,Babylon,I'm with the elephant!,3,"In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.Writer/director Damien Chazelle, who gave us LA LA LAND a few years ago, turns the clock back to the 1920s when ""Hollywoodland"" was transitioning from silent pictures to sound. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie play two leading actors who flounder during this period of adjustment, cast in a series of tawdry flops. Diego Calva and Jovan Adepo play a Mexican production assistant and a jazz trumpeter whose careers briefly flare. All four stars make the best of their roles despite the chaotic screenplay. Robbie's damaged character, a stock favorite, fueled by addiction to cocaine and gambling, is overdone and risks losing the viewer's sympathy.Orgiastic parties and a weird scene in a mountain torture palace presided over by Tobey Maguire in overdrive bring echoes of historic Babylon and some of the weirder extremes of early Hollywood. And there are many references to SINGING IN THE RAIN, that gem of a film set in the same era as this mash-up - one of the all-time greatest movies. With its messy script, erratic direction and uneven editing, BABYLON is in an altogether different league. I can't think of a picture I've hated as much as this. Sorry!"
55,Babylon,Ambitious film torpedoed by weak and self-indulgent script,3,"As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, CA 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer=director Damien Chazelle. Let me admit up front that I absolutely LOVED all three of his prior movies (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", and ""First Man""). Hence I went into this film with high expectations. Alas, I shouldn't have. ""Babylon"" certainly is well done from a technical perspective (photography, editing, musical score), but it misfires badly from a substantive perspective. The storyline is supposed to show us how Hollywood's transition from silent films into talkies was a success for some and a disaster for others. But what we get to see here is a self-indulgent, unfocused, and over-long movie, torpedoed by its weak script. (Can someone please tell me what the point of the snake fight scene was? Or of the freak show towards the end of the film? And that's just naming those two). The all-star cast certainly gives its best shot with the weak material that they are given, but in the end this film cannot be saved. This is 3+ hours of my live I'm never getting back.""Babylon"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but COVID had other ideas. It was just released in US theaters this past weekend, and vastly underperformed at the box office. Let's just say it as it is: it tanked. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 10 people). I cannot imagine that Babylon will have long legs at the box office, or that it will pick up a bunch of Oscar nominations. For that the movie is simply too weak, too long and over-indulgent for its own good. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you liked Chazelle's earlier films, I'd suggest you check this out (albeit with low expectations), and draw your own expectation."
56,Babylon,Damien's Inferno,3,"In the words of SuperHotFire, I'm about to end Damien Chazelle's whole career.Babylon is a preposterously bad movie. At the same it's an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life. It's aggressively vile. For the vast majority of three hours, you are locked in with this movie as it assaults you with graphic visual depictions of virtually every bodily function imaginable. Supposedly, this is a commentary on the evil, exploitative and corrupt studio system that destroyed old Hollywood. Damien Chazelle, having started his career planting a sloppy wet kiss on the industry with the maudlin, yet beautifully constructed La La Land comes back 6 years later with a film filled with nothing but hatred and anger. But at the same time, that's still not what Babylon wants to be. It wants to be an unforgettable epic. Chazelle wants to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese and P. T. Anderson. He wanted to make a film that sweepingly celebrates the beauty and horror of an American artistic movement. He's so emotionally invested as a Hollywood man that its driven him completely insane. Not since Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate has such a psychotic Hollywood movie been made. If it had just been a Molotov cocktail thrown at Hollywood, and nothing more, Babylon could have been a stroke of genius. Instead, it is so gluttonously self-indulgent and conceptually unstable, that I've lost any kind of respect that I may have had for Chazelle as a director before.Now let's take a step back. Are there any redeeming qualities about Babylon? Yes. Two scenes in particular showcase the immense skill that Chazelle still has as a director and offer glimpses of the kind of good movie Babylon could have been. The scene that details the grueling creation of the first talking movie is both hilarious and exhilarating in showing how impossible it was to work with the new technology. When the film points to the lengths at which Hollywood executives exploited their new silver screen stars through their race and gender, it offers a stunningly profound depiction of the emotional abuse that was inflicted on the actors. But all of that is buried under an avalanche of sophomoric pornography. When the characters aren't cursing like truck drivers, they are having ravenous sex or projectile vomiting, or urinating on each other. This film wants to be The Wolf of Wall Street, Boogie Nights and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas all at the same time. But it's none of those films. It is instead a fascinating race to the bottom. I can't say that I wasn't entertained by the experience. I was wildly amused by it, in fact. But I also felt dirty as I walked out of the theater seeing this. Only see this film if you are with an audience of people who are blacked-out drunk or so high that they cover the screen with pot smoke. I'd assume that would be a blast of an experience."
57,Babylon,An indulgent mess with surprisingly little to say,4,"Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" isn't one of them. 4/10."
58,Babylon,"A big, bloated, shapeless mess, filled with lazy caricatures",4,"I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera. But ultimately I think Chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it."
59,Babylon,Margot is all in!,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.Writer-director Damien Chazelle (Oscar winner, LA LA LAND, 2016) sets the stage for his wild and frenzied epic meant (I think) as a tribute to early Hollywood and the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies. Of course, that topic has been handled in other prestige films - recently with THE ARTIST (2011), as well as the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952). It's the latter which serves as a template or guidepost for Chazelle, to such an extent that he shows clips from it, quotes it, and even has a couple of his characters share similarities with Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood.From the moment she crashes onto the party scene, this becomes Margot Robbie's movie. Fully engaged doesn't begin to describe how she embodies the Nellie LaRoy character. Nellie is a displaced Jersey girl desperate to break into showbiz, and she pursues stardom with everything she has to offer. Nellie is a risk-taker and literal gambler, and the character is supposedly inspired by the infamous Clara Bow. It's at that first wild party where she meets both Jack Conrad (Oscar winner Brad Pitt) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva). Conrad is a huge silent movie star, and also a boozing womanizer with the accompanying swagger (supposedly based on actor John Gilbert). Manny, though a much quieter soul, is much like Nellie in that his ambition is to work in the movie business. The two discuss their dreams while tearing into mounds of cocaine.Nellie's fearlessness in front of the camera (much like Ms. Robbie's) pays off as the offers roll in and she makes her name. She and Manny periodically cross paths as he climbs the ladder towards studio executive. We also keep up with Jack Conrad and his stream of wives, and how things begin to change with THE JAZZ SINGER and the advent of talking motion pictures. While all this is happening, the film also (sorta) follows the career of jazz trumpeter Sidney Powell (Jovan Adepo) as he builds a career as a black performer on screen. One of the more interesting characters who we wish had more screen time is Lady Fay (played by Li Jun Li). We are rarely treated to a Chinese lesbian chanteuse, and she makes each of her scenes quite fascinating.Others in the cast include Olivia Wilde as one of Jack Conrad's many wives, Lukas Haas as an industry guy, Eric Roberts as Nellie's hustler dad, Pat Skipper as William Randolph Hearst, and Max Minghella as the legendary Irving Thalberg. They are each fine, but none as memorable as Tobey Maguire (also a producer on the film), who has a funny/creepy cameo as a fictional giggling gangster named James McKay. However, it's Jean Smart as Elinor St John, a gossip columnist in the mold of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who has the film's best scene when she deals the hard truth to Jack Conrad. Ms. Smart seems to excel in every role she takes these days, and this may be one of her best, albeit with limited screen time.The issues with the film have nothing to do with its entertainment value and outrageous moments or with the performances. Each of those things keep us watching. It's only when we stop and think about it when the problems come into focus. Most blatant is the love story between Manny and Nellie. They actually spend very little time together after their cocaine feast. Certainly not enough to fall in love. There is a 'blackface' scene unlike anything you've seen before, and in 3 hours and 8 minutes director Chazelle follows up the projectile elephant poop with vomit from a drug overdose, vomit from something other than a drug overdose, a urine stream, and rattlesnake venom. At times it seems like he wanted to see just how much he could get away with.Chazelle collaborators from LA LA LAND include cinematographer Linus Sandgren composer Justin Hurwitz, and Film Editor Tom Cross, all three are Oscar winners from that film, and all provide superb work here. The technical aspects of the film are terrific, it's as a story (or stories) where things unravel. It's simply bloated and overly ambitious, while having some of the frenetic pacing of Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE! Or THE GREAT GATSBY. It appears filmmaker Chazelle is attempting to reinforce cinema is art as a spectacle, when most of us don't require more proof. The movie montage at the end is fun to watch, but strikes this viewer as a bit indulgent after a long movie. Buckle up for a wild ride and enjoy to good stuff.Opens in theaters on December 23, 2022."
60,Babylon,"A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema",8,"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10."
61,Babylon,desperately trying too hard,6,"It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far. I do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work."
62,Babylon,Decadence,7,"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness."
63,Babylon,A cinematic experience,10,"Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever."
64,Babylon,Sometimes less is more,5,I can see why the reviews are polarized and why people hate the film. It's a frustrating film at times mainly cause there is so much going on. Right off the bat it's crazy flash and busy tho I enjoyed it at first at the film progressed it gets more busy and busy and then the ending is so busy and goes on and on and on and it doesn't know when to end. That's the main fault of the film is that less is more and that would of helped the film. There is also much characters that the supporting characters don't get enough screen time and story that they seem pointless at times or lost. The acting is amazing especially Margot Robbie who deserves all the praise for the film. I get what the film was aiming at but it just lands where you hate or love it at times. It's frustrating and at times gives you a headache. I overall enjoyed the film at times and thought it was ok though I would not recommended the film.
65,Babylon,Decadent Decay...,6,"Far too long, for the reward that it withholds, although it's fearless and adventurous, quite daring and quite bold, overflowing with depravity, full of wicked immorality, indulgence and degeneracy, quite an orgy that unfolds.The Roaring Twenties, and roaring doesn't quite capture the excesses presented here with a film that paints quite a colourful picture of the world of silent movies and their transition to the planet of sound. Margot Robbie smashes it out of the park, as well as producing voluminous amounts of vomit, however, take away the spectacle, and you're left with an often told tale you've seen many times before, and an eager anticipation to watch Singin' in the Rain for the nth time, a revisit your unlikely to make quite as often with this, as once is more than enough."
66,Babylon,"Decadent, Depraved And Tasteless",3,This movie shows how spoiled rotten actors are. They get paid massive amounts of money to pretend to be someone they are not. They drink and drug excessively. They have outrageous and decadent parties all the time. They have all the fame and fortune in the world and it's never enough for them. I honestly don't have too much sympathy for them in many ways. This movie has no actual plot. It's just spoiled actors acting like whiny children. It also is excessively long at over three hours of Hollywood psychosis.I for one don't worship actors like this movie wants me to. They aren't my gods. They are just people who get paid way too much for their profession. Hollywood was depraved back in the 20's and it still is now. I don't need to be reminded of that.
67,Babylon,That was awful.,2,"SCORE: 2.0/10My brain hurts. Wow that was awful. I wouldn't even make my worst enemy have to sit and watch that for 3+ hours. Did some of the people who reviewed this take some of that stuff they kept showing throughout the film? That was a complete mess.It was just unorganized chaos. The only bright spot, if there was one, was Margot Robbie. I am in love with that woman. She was a part of some of the films best scenes, but there weren't many of those. No matter how amazing she was, I couldn't get over how terrible what I was watching was, with a plot that was all over the place and consistently boring. This movie had no business being over 3 hrs long. I don't even have the energy to write more about this film."
68,Babylon,"Outstanding, multi-genre mash up with many jaw dropping moments.",9,"Damian Chazelle doesn't make bad movies (whiplash, La La Land, First Man) but much of what I'd heard about Babylon in advance of seeing (no experiencing) it for myself was less than complimentary.Turgid, overlong, rambling, too strident and lacking a narrative.Well, in my view, all of those criticisms are both unfounded and unfair, because Babylon is magnificent.It's an epic story spanning thirty years, beginning in the silent era when Hollywood was in its most outrageous Klondike era.The talkies would pivot the narrative when Al Jolson's Jazz Singer arrived, but for now anything went and that's where the movie begins in a lavish set piece piece that starts with a scatalogical Elephant episode and culminates, some 25 minutes late, in a drug fuelled frenzy at the end of all parties.Then up comes the title credit, fully 25 minutes in.It's jaw dropping and hilarious.We then see the, also hilarious, growth of silent cinema where anyone with a mind, and a budget to do it, can do it. This is where Brad Pitt (a matinee idol in his final years) and Margot Robbie (a wannabe with talent and gumption) dominate proceedings with Robbie putting in a career high performance.In the third act the story slows down considerably and assumes a narrative direction before all hell breaks loose in the penultimate chapter (it turns into a horror film, with a stand out cameo from Toby MaGuire, that morphs into a psychedelic episode that Kubrick would have loved, before reaching its Jazzy musical finale.It's three hours of endless ideas, superb styling, sets and costume design.In using Singing In the Rain as a central plot device, and theme for the movie's funniest sequence on an early sound stage, Chazelle treats us to his first real exploration of humour.It's an homage, as the whole movie is, to the greatest days of hollywood. It's a comedy, a romance, a horror and a musical all rolled into one.And the music. On my, fans of La La Land will enjoy the musical themes that run throughout and are a direct follow up to his first masterpiece.I applauded the movie as the final curtain came down. It contains more ideas, more vitality, more chutzpah than anything I've seen for ages and I for one hope to see it rewarded at the Hollywood gongs night in the spring.Bravo."

70,Babylon,Indeed an epic film; not kidding!!!,10,"I love the cinema! Babylon is a spectacular epic film, truly a masterpiece. I think this movie deserves the Oscar for best picture of the year. It is a remarkable story following several characters living the dream and the starlight of Hollywood. Chazelle has created a movie that is a love letter to Hollywood not because of depraved parties or preventing talented minorities from becoming stars but from reflecting how far Hollywood has become.I was amazed by the Oscar-worthy performances from Margot Robbie. She is fantastic and deserves a nomination. Brad Pitt is excellent as well, and the newcomer Mexican actor Diego Calva wow, perfectly carried the whole movie; he had great chemistry with Robbie. Jean Smart was fantastic, specifically the cameo with Brad Pitt, and Tobey Maguire was hilarious. Three hours of such a spectacle from beginning to end. I loved the cinematography, and the musical score is out of this world. You feel you want to dance and sing. The story was great and nostalgic. Come on, people, I can see it was harsh for some prunes not to like the movie because of the sex and drug content, but it is far from being the objective.I loved the cameos of the movie sets that show the evolution from silent to talkies. If you love movies as much as I do, you will love Babylon, and finally, I want to tell you that the ending is epic; I don't want to spoil telling you about it. Please, see it on the big screen.Please do not read the low ratings of critics; they are full of it!"
71,Babylon,Felt like scrolling through TikTok,1,"I really want to understand what the producers thought. Who is the audience? It seems like another movie made for Hollywood bubble by Hollywood bubble. Actually It was not a movie -It was a mix of random scenes. 90% of them were pointless aka snake scene (WTF?) Définition of cringe with Jokes that don't land well but made embarrassed anyone who is slightly intelligent.There are No developed characters. No true motives no dilemmas. I have never seen so many people walking off ever, half way through I wanted to leave as well but hoped at least for a surprising ending - nope, the ending and the connection to the "" cinema paradiso "" was cliché and laughable. In a certain moment I thought it was badly done on purpose as they wanted to do it as in 30s. Like Ed Wood movie. That would be cool, but again such a disappointmentOne very dramatic scene with Brad Pitt was so predictable, people at the audience laughed out loud they couldn't stand how ridiculous it was and how predictable.I had high hopes, left disappointed and with 3h of my life wasted."
72,Babylon,I thought it was great!,8,"Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.Babylon had an impressive ensemble cast lead by Margot Robbie. There were a few stories going through the movie and they intertwined really well. Never a dull moment at all, and thanks to the ensemble cast we got to touch on a lot of subjects that was Old School Hollywood. Socialism, racism, ageism, sexism. An all across the broad look just showing you how it wasAnd speaking of never a dull moment, going into this, I thought this movie was just going to be about a Hollywood party (technically, you can say the movie is about keeping the party going). The movie is long but it worth it because those scenes where they showed you how Hollywood Partied almost 100 years ago. You could never get away with that kind of epicness now.Plus, it was a visually stunning film too. Enjoyable from beginning to end."
73,Babylon,A good and a bad movie in one,5,"The Good,
Great character from Brad Pitt, adding depth and nuance to his character.The arc of something exciting meeting it's peak and declining., and the loss and aftermath of that.Some interesting and fun scenes telling some folklore stories from the period. Of note the multiple shoots happening on the one film lot and the lengths they had to go to to get the shot, including running to get a new camera (the 2708 or 2709?), and the legendary operations and safety standards lawless zone of time culminating in the perfect sunset and the perfect single tear scene. Also the first sound shoot with the camera in the hot box and the very demanding requirements of sound recording and hitting your marks. Both of those were great scenes using folk law and history to make an interesting and watchable scene.The right place right time concept with people just chancing the be there for things to happen, being in at the start and having the verve to get up and do stuff. Especially evident for Diego Calva's character Manny.The bad.Childish and puerile details and setup too many to mention just destroyed all the good will and good work of the actors. We get it, it was hedonistic, and the writer director wants to be edgy, but so many of these scenes were misjudged, mismanaged and ultimately hurt the film for their inclusion. Does director Damien Chazelle not have a friend to tell him, ""nah, don't do that, that's not a good idea"". There must be quite a few yesmen and crew to go along with some of the more revolting and unnecessary and more importantly un-entertaining moments. (elephant, posh dinner puking, much of the opening party watersports etc etc). Why did anyone thing that stuff would add to or help make a good movie.So bloated. If you chopped out the childish puerile stuff that would only half sort the length. Just too many unnecessary story lines wedged in. The Sidney Palmer story line had almost no impact on the main story. It contributed very little to the overall effect and just repeated the same theme of movies ask you to sell your soul then spit you out thing. So too the Lady Fay Zhu story. Maybe they needed a different movie to tell their arcs but their inclusion really really bulked up the movie to a point where it dragged. It was way too long, and became a chore to get through.The over sentimental rose tinted glasses hollywood loving itself and telling us what a great and important thing they have done and given to society, and how important they are and how reverential we should be of their noble sacrifice is and the torment they have to suffer with great wealth and fame, all in the packaging of an excessive expensive modern day film. Give us a break will you. It all rang incredibly hollow and ugly and did the opposite of making us love those loveable rascals actors directors and film makers in general. I really disliked the noble industry by the end of this movie, and partially because of the film that was trying to tell their story. It highlight what is so very very wrong with Hollywood. The privilege of our attention is so often wasted on the undeserving. Damien Chazelle abused that privilege with the finished movie he delivered. Not all bad but what was bad was really bad and erased much of the good."
74,You People,The racism actually got on my nerves...,6,"The black side actually aggravated me more than anything. I'm black and I was almost embarrassed. They just seem incredibly racist! For all that Jonah Hill's character tried to do, it just seems as if they couldn't acknowledge it. They didn't care. He was white and that was the problem. At one point I almost wanted to scream at the screen. As for the white family, or side of the family, they're ignorance, to me, was them just trying to make the girl feel welcomed, in their own misguided way. There were times when this movie actually became a tad bit painful to watch. I know they're supposed to be a moral to this, but this movie almost promoted racism. They, in my opinion, wanted to turn the white mom interest a ""Karen"" unfairly. I actually felt bad for her because she didn't realize what she was doing and it was brought to her attention in a horrible way. Also, I think Jonah Hill's character was much stronger than Lauren London's character, Amira.Also, side note! It annoyed me that Eddie Murphy said the ""N"" word in every other sentence in this movie but took issue with white people. I've had I've always had an issue with this because I've just felt like if you don't like it being said, don't you say it.."
75,You People,Those People.,4,"You know, the ones who wrote all the cliched nonsense with the shallow dialogue, in attempt to make a social satirical rom-com, that ended up flopping miserably. And those that failed to direct the all-star cast properly, so they all ended up being unconvincing in everything they did and said.I've seen failed SNL sketches with better execution, more urgency in the acting, with coherent and cohesive dialogue. But instead, those people gave us a long, dragged out, boring and shallow blah-blah commentary, with zero laughs, that will have you struggle to stay awake in this predictable sloth-paced nonsense.Such a waste of a talented cast. This is one of those films that is more annoying than entertaining, and aside from the predictable romance as the core of the film, everything else is just forced, feels phony, and flops from every angle. I can't even suggest it's a decent one-time watch, because I feel like I've wasted 2 hours I'll never get back."
76,You People,Astonishingly annoying,4,"It's been some time that I've been so bewildered and frustrated watching a film.This very talented cast is absolutely wasted on a terrible script filled with inane and outdated jokes. It's 2023, I think we've moved beyond the ridiculous viewpoints and stereotypes displayed in this film. The characters behave in such ridiculous ways. Eddie Murphy suddenly just decides to stop being a racist piece of crap and Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an awakening about how to speak to black people normally. It's all just so freaking annoying to watch.Hill and London also have net zero chemistry between them, which funny enough, really tends to tank a romantic comedy."
77,You People,"The most annoying film of 2023, it made me so angry!",1,"When mum turned to watch this godforsaken movie on Netflix, it was honestly so unbearable to watch but yet I sat through it all and felt that I need @5 118 minutes back. The amount of black this, white that, every skin colour being aggressively mentioned on the show made it just so tiring and extremely annoying. I don't care if you're every colour of the rainbow like cmon man this is 21st century, enough with the labels and make a decent movie goddamnitt!The cast were good but the writing and the aggressive label slapping made it such a bad movie. I think the 5/10 rating is too nice because it's honestly a 0.00000 for me."
78,You People,You People made a terrible movie,1,"How did this ever get made? Old Man Jonah Hill is miscast as a 35 year old who wants to marry a black woman. Only problem is their families, one Jewish and one Muslim, don't get along. In fact, they have a lot of very insensitive conversations about race and religion. I supposed someone thought this was funny, but it is not. The attempts at humor fall very flat. The jokes are not funny. The cast looks bored. Film looks like it was made in one or two takes and a lot of the dialogue feels like they just made it up as they went along. It's almost shocking this many talented people got in a room and said and did so much stupid unfunny stuff. A miserable comedy."
79,You People,The very definition of CRINGE,1,"In recent years, Hill has tried to branch out on his own with his Directors debut and other various works but with this last project its apparent hes incapable of being great while taking the lead. Films like Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street were great because of good direction, spectacular writing and good lead actors.You People...Screenwriters/Director Kenya Barris and Jonah Hill do a masterful job depicting racism and twisting it into their own definition of comedy. The result? Cringe with a splash of garbage is exactly what this film was.Love Jonah Hill but not when hes taking charge.Glad this was free. I just cant get back those precious minutes i could have used to watch paint dry."
80,You People,Woke is getting old.,2,"First, let me tell you what I like about this movie: I guess I would say that Julia's new face is pretty cool. Clearly she recently had a facelift.Now what I don't like about this film: as other reviewers have said, this movie was trying to be both a comedy and a social commentary. But neither one of them worked. And then we have the usual stereotypes: all Black people are angry about their oppression and aren't afraid to tell the world about it. The Black people are streetsmart and intelligent. But then we have the white people. They are all clueless, racist, and guilt ridden. Every word out of their mouths is racist and of course they don't even know that it is. This is really getting old. Why can't we just have a movie with white people and Black people being normal human beings. But I guess Hollywood needs to preach it's politics to us, so it's probably not going to end soon."
81,You People,Stupid!,1,"This movie, if you can call it that, is pretty bad. The humour is forced and not funny. The way people think in it is the way the most stupid elements of society think, a tiny minority, thank God. The cliches and stereotypes are horrible because they're so unrealistic here. Like a black Moslem would never use n-gga to address a black person or anyone else actually. This is exactly the kind of behavior they're against. I could take satire but this is out of this world. Eddie Murphy looks so out of it in this movie, like he couldn't wait for the whole thing to be over. I guess he's in it because he thinks he has to stay relevant. Also the production of the movie itself is lame. There's no artistry to it whatsoever. It could have been shot with one of today's quality phones and edited on a home computer.Believe the rating here. This movie is going nowhere."
82,You People,meh...,2,"Even Julia Louis-Dreyfuss can't save this one. Did it have a good premise? It sure did, for about forty years ago.So, they took a tired old storyline, added in some pretty good talent which might have saved it, then stupidly added in the requisite Hollywood dreck that completely ruined it - they had to make it non-stop about black vs. White and they did it about as poorly and tediously as they possibly could. The endless comments and ""jokes"" are incredibly tiresome and do nothing to bring anyone together, especially not the audience, they only serve to further alienate us from each other.Honestly, just a huge waste of some good actors and the viewers time."
83,You People,You People.. Try Hard,5,"You People is definitely a 5 but at least a somewhat watchable and likable 5. It definitely had a few funny moments overall. But it absolutely tried WAY TOO hard to be a good movie and to be funny and to call attention to race relations. It was just way too much of an over exaggeration by both sides. While sometimes it was funny, it was mainly just in your face and way over done. The story itself was fairly straightforward and very obvious. It's worth watching just because it's free and on Netflix but don't expect anything legitimately good. IMDb needs to chill with these character limits!!!!!"
84,You People,Cringeworthy,2,"You People is so poorly written and 'unintentionally' racist that you'd think it was written by Michael Scott. The entire movie is basically an amalgamation of the worst stereotypes around black, 'muslim' (I use air quotes because the characters are actually NOI members the movie misleadingly portrays as muslim), and jewish people despite its message purportedly being the opposite. Actually, I'm not entirely sure what their message was supposed to be but to me it basically came off as promoting segregation.This movie is pretty much a symbol of everything wrong with post-2015 Hollywood social commentaries... it's almost like twitter addiction has melted the mind of every writer in LA. It got so bad at points that I started to wonder if it was a conservative strawman/parody of urban progressives.Beyond that the jokes/culture references are mostly 10 years out of date and unfunny, the soundtrack rarely aligns with the scenes it plays over, the transitions between scenes look straight out of a mid 2000's disney channel show, and I'm not sure what possessed the creators to cast Jonah Hill of all people as a 'likable' lead in a romantic comedy -- it just doesn't work."
85,You People,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,"The most cringeworthy movies I have ever seen.The Jewish characters in the movies are incredibly insulting and disreputable, and pull out almost every possible stereotype.Every scene is a cringe fest. It's truly painful to watch.I am undecided if Jonah Hill's character is the worst, or Julia Louis Dreyfus?Horrible cameos by Richard Benjamin, and Elliot Gould don't help.The scene in the synagogue, on Yom Kippur, was particularly insulting and disreputable.Maybe the Holocaust comments?Or even the Malcolm X ones? So much to pick at.In an era of increasing antisemitic violence, a movie like this just fuels the flames.If it were on screen, there would be protests at the theatres."
86,You People,"Tries to be a modern update on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, but ends up as a mediocre R-rated remake of Guess Who?",5,"Ezra Cohen (Jonah Hill) is a stockbroker who also runs a podcast with his best friend, Mo (Sam Jay), where the two discuss various facets of black culture (or ""the culture"" as Ezra calls it). Ezra is under pressure from his Jewish family particularly his mother Shelley (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find a woman but Ezra has a streak of bad luck with his family's setups. Meanwhile costume designer Amira Mohammed (Lauren London) is also dealing with pressure from her opinionated father Akbar (Eddie Murphy) a devout Black Muslim. When Ezra and Amira have a chance encounter they eventually start a relationship until after some time Ezra intends to propose to Amira, but the two's families prove to be a massive obstacle.You People is a new romantic comedy directed and co-written by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and co-written and starring Jonah Hill. The movie features an impressive cast with the likes of Jonah Hill, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Nia Long, and Deavid Duchovny among several others, and from the marketing you'd probably expect a modern update the framework established by Guess Who's Coming to Dinner with its potentially rich premise of a Jewish family and Black Muslim family creating friction with one another over an incoming wedding, unfortunately while You People has a potentially rich and provocative setup, its payoff feels like a tired rehash of the Fockers films or 2005's Guess Who? With little more brought to the table than an R-rating.On a positive note, I will say that Hill and London have decent chemistry in their scenes together and on occasion there is an awkward laugh to be taken from individual exchanges in the film, but for the most part the movie doesn't feel like it has a developed cast of characters with most of the talented expanded cast playing very broad one note at best or are given the short shrift at worst. Poor David Duchovny is saddle with a terrible running gag about him going on shpiel's about Xzibit and Elliott Gould is given one line and spends most his presence in the background doing nothing most of the time. Eddie Murphy is also saddled with a role that doesn't play to his strengths as Akbar is a very serious and stoic man who isn't funny or interesting because he's been force to subdue his charisma and he really only comes to life in the role in the last 10 minutes. A large chunk of the movie is an endless parade of scenes where either Ezra or his parents make fools of themselves giving rambling unsolicited commentary on race relations and there's very few scenes where people talk like human beings and these segments are just variations on the same point repeatedly. The movie is also way too long at just under two hours and it feels its length.You People had a lot of promise as a comedy, but it just does not work at all and most of the best scenes are in the trailer with the rest of the movie an overlong slog that struggles to keep itself going. Sometimes the cast do get a mild snicker from certain exchanges, but not really enough to justify a viewing. Maybe if someone like Jerrod Carmichael had tapped into this kind of material (see On the Count of Three or The Carmichael Show for proof) then maybe something of substance could've been done with it, but as is, it's a mediocre comedy that feels like 2005's Guess Who? With an R-rating."
87,You People,Netflix does it again.,2,"Yet another comedy stinker from Netflix, i don't know how they do it.I had high hopes this would be a slightly better than average comedy film (only slightly better because this is Netflix). Stars Jonah Hill, Julia Louis Dreyfus and Eddie Murphy so you kind of expect something ok but instead get something which to be honest is nothing more than annoying. Every character talks in that quick witted way that only happens in the movies, after a while it becomes slightly wearing as its so unrealistic but not as unrealist and really annoying all the white characters do that desparate trying not to sound racist but ending up sounding racist dialogue that has been done to death in so many comedies. Frankly this is embarrassing too watch."
88,You People,Uncomfortable movie to watch. Not always on purpose.,5,"It's very difficult to try to receive a film that collides not only two cultures, but four if we consider the religions of the characters. It's even more difficult when the viewer doesn't belong to any of the 4 cultures on display. And as if that were not enough, it's even more difficult when the tone of the film is a comedy that tries to speak supposed truths through the comic voice of Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy.Everyone's speech feels forced, exaggerated and awkward and I think only the latter was intended. I find it one of the most uncomfortable movies to watch, but not only because of the cultural collision, but also because the characters were real idiots, including the leading couple. Everything would have been easier if they were in charge of the wedding themselves to avoid all the chaos generated by decisions that were made by people who were never supposed to have made them. Although without this, we would not have a movie either.Now, it's not all bad. I like the aesthetics of the film, I like the cultural niche in which it's inserted, I like the directorial work behind the shots. I really hope to see reviews from moviegoers who do have a real sense of belonging in the social circles that are exposed in the film, because this would definitely be a much more valid opinion."
89,You People,Simply an awful movie,1,"This thing was terribly written, terribly directed, terribly acted (except for Eddie Murphy and Lauren London - they were good). Did Jonah Hill think his greasy, slicked-back, blonde-streaked hair would ""fit"" this role? What was he doing? He looked like a homeless crack head. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was so stupid and annoying - and those qualities do not equate to funny. David Duchovny had really nothing to do but act like a spaced-out jackass - so well done for him. Attempted humor about so many subjects that simply just cannot be joked about. I see this thing sweeping the Razzies next year. Way to go Netflix!"
90,You People,Awful !!! Just boring !!!,1,"So far, the worst movie I´ve seen this year. After 10 minutes I wanted to stop watching. A lot of moronic and unnecessary cursing.It has a great cast but even with that, the writing is just awful. I never laughed. Not even once!!!Watching paint dry is way more exciting than watching this snoozefest.It is unfortunate that there are no good comedies anymore. Nowaday´s movies are about sci-fi (mostly super heroes), horror and drama. No wonder why many people are so depressed. Good movies and good music are sadly a thing from the past now.I rather watch reruns of Eddie Murphy´s 80s films and his 80s stand ups Delirious and Raw and reruns of Seinfeld (with Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as Elaine) and The X-Files (With David Duchovny as FBI Agent Mulder)."
91,You People,"Well, the formulated message is better than the (should not have been) medicore movie.",5,"Not a surprise, I guess.What did I know about this movie? Eddie Murphy is in it. For me he still has the stigma that I'm gonna get some good laughs if he does this movie. Jonah Hill is in this movie. I think Jonah Hill is funny. He has the perfect wit for Eddie to bounce jokes off of. I also saw in the trailer Nia Long is in it and I felt she was a fine enough actress for Eddie to bounce jokes off of.None of that happened. Julia Louis Dreyfuss and David Duchovny are also in the movie and they were ready to make us laugh and they did but it was so minimal. Can't say I did not laugh but I was hoping this cast would give me far more than they did.There was a point in which comedian Mike Epps, who gave me bigger laughs than Murphy, were doing a scene together and I got nothing.Comedian Andrew Schulz was in the movie, involved in a scene that had me giggling when I should have been busting a gut.All I can say is Kenya Burris hit the motherload with Blackish and the universeish (I don't know if that's what it's called), but he can't replicate it. BlackAF was a very bad replication of Blackish and You People also seems to take elements Burris touched on before, (which is not a bad thing, do what you know) but somehow it just never matches the Gold he did with Blackish.His comedy on mixed relations is getting tired, You People felt tired, and it seemed that all Eddie was doing was playing Kenya Burris and that's not what this movie needed.Not as bad as I am making it out to be but all I see is something that could have been so much better."
92,You People,Eddie Murphy hasn't aged,2,"Movie was one gigantic stereotype. Jonah Hill is heavy again, but still accurately Jewish. Every Jewish and especially African American stereotype was used. Of course "" boomers"" are always the morons that they are nowadays. All music is some form of misogynistic rap interspersed like the '70s show. Eddie Murphy does not look 61, but his acting is like he is 61. Does have lots of cameos- especially in the beginning. I suppose if you have Netflix, you might watch since it's made and filmed in LA. I watched it on a cross continent flight, so I had no problem finishing, but you have seen this before- just not as obnoxiously."
93,You People,You People... shouldn't have made this film.,2,"Guess who's coming to dinner? Nobody if you show them this film. Culture/race clash comedy where the comedy revolves around a mixed race couple and their respective parent's. One group Jewish, the other Black Muslim.Blac Dad hates white people. Jewish Mum frequently says the wrong thing to sound more accepting. Any comedy that tries a gag of one upmanship themed around the Slave Trade vs. The Holocaust is scraping the bottom of a barrel that shouldn't even exist.The cast has the pedigree to make the jokes land. Several SNL alumni alone should be up to task, but they just don't have much to work with."
94,You People,LA People,4,"Let's face it: you can set a comedy in Los Angeles and it'll always achieve nominal success. A multicultural cast, socially relevant humor, cool music, drone shots and boom - that's a movie. There's something about palm trees and attractive people that'll never go out of style.But this formula is beyond old. You have to have that thing that makes it stand out. Something fresh, something new under the sun. I'm not sure if it's the studios, writers or talent, but a major part of that team is resting on their laurels.I loved the casting of old school comedic actors that are likely singing their swan song. The plot is tried and true, and it normally works. I just wish the filmmakers of You People did their homework to give us a film worthy of all their unorthodox comedic talents.Too bad You People wouldn't make it into the 'staff picks' of a Thousand Oaks Blockbuster. How's that for old school and sarcastic?"
95,You People,And now all celebrities recommend it (facepalm),3,"First of all I don't understand what's with Netflix,why every movie should be like two hours?! Two hours and half?! Especially when you have a very shallow old school boring scenario for 1h30min MAX.I don't know what is your purpose anymore. All that labels about black people and then about white people oh and then about religious beliefs traditions ugh. Please stop! It's not funny,it's not educational,you bring nothing with this. We learn nothing. And I repeat,it's not funny!!And of course all celebrities like the Kardashians,Bierbers etc are promoting this movie like it is something phenomenal. It is not! Just same old song same old story how ""black people are not this or that"" and how ""white people are exactly this or that""."
96,You People,Overwhelming,1,"I gave it 10 minutes and shut it off - so I didn't even get to see one of my favorite performers, Eddie Murphy. There were too many distasteful jokes, the dialogue was complex and confusing, and the stereotyping was nauseating. I actually was raised Jewish so I hoped to feel a cultural connection.Jonah Hill is usually a funny and sharp actor, but he didn't have the right spark here. He also looked uncomfortable and rigid.Netflix has the mindset that they can bring together a group of big-name actors/comedians and somehow that it will be a humorous 2-hour ride. The formula simply doesn't work."
97,You People,Offensive but not the worst thing in the world,4,"OK, as a black woman I was looking at it as a modern Something New. I genuinely enjoyed Kenya Barris' other works. Yet, I found Jonah Hill and Lauren London's characters so cliche and shallow in an unrelatable way that the familial conflict seemed forced.LL's character lost me early on just by calling her own $40k car cheap. As an Ivy Leaguer with three degrees, she had completely lost my sympathy by her job interview scene. That said, I respect Howard enough to know that she should have brought it better.We genuinely live in an age when families need to embrace other cultures. This film, however, just reminds me of the one dimensional interracial comedies of the past. And not in a good way!"
98,You People,You People,5,"You People made me laugh... A lot. The comedy is good. Jonah Hill & Kenya Barris wrote some good jokes.What they didn't do is make a good film. Whoever decided this should be the film Kenya Barris should debut his directing skills needs to be fired. This film looks like a really cheap sitcom. Also i said the jokes are good but the story sucks and has been done a million times.Eddie Murphy actually is refreshing to see just playing a normal guy instead of one of his crazy characters. Jonah Hill also puts forth a good performance. Lauren London is a queen and does her thing. David Ducovney is completely wasted, but its Julia Louis Dreyfus who steals the show. Shes just the funniest person in the film.All in all its a cheap looking, unoriginal, well acted, funny rom com that could've easily been made 20 years ago. It's just ok."
99,Knock at the Cabin,"This movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have",6,"Knock at the Cabin (2023) is a new M. Night Shyamalan picture my wife and I caught at an A24 Advance Screening last night. The storyline follows two men and their daughter on vacation at a cabin in the woods. They are visited and captured by four individuals who come out of the woods with an ultimatum...one of the three must die at the hands of the other two or the world will end. As time runs down the family sees the death and destruction the visitors promised. Will the family let everyone die, will they save the world or is it all an elaborate game being played by four psychopaths?As previously referenced, this picture is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Rupert Grint (Harry Potter), Ben Aldridge (Our Girl), Nikki Amuka-Bird (Jupiter Ascending), Jonathan Groff (The Matrix: Resurrection) and Abby Quinn (After the Wedding).The storyline and characters in this picture had a lot of potential; but unfortunately, every situation is straightforward and predictable, all the way to the final scene. It's too bad because the cinematography and camera angles are very good and Dave Bautista delivers an outstanding performance. His character was easily my favorite. However, the characters backstories needed to be more developed, more like The Stand, before they all met at the cabin. I didn't really care what happened to those characters (the decisions were too easy to make for the family). The kill scenes themselves needed more gore and intensity. They definitely could have been better executed to highlight the situation the parents were in. The conclusion is straightforward and you know what's going to happen and how.Unfortunately, this movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once."
100,Knock at the Cabin,You already know the ending,6,"The worst part of this for me was that the ending only feels satisfying if you truly believed that the four horsemen were lying, which I rarely did. And because of that, the non-twist of exactly what they said would happen happening is a wet-blanket on a movie I kept thinking would have that twist at the end that made it all worth watching, but it never did. The twist was there was no twist. I didn't enjoy that. This movie tells you exactly what will happen from the start and that's that, so as long as you trust what they say, the film has zero impact whatsoever. The only reason this gets a 6 from me is the writing in the first 2/3 of the movie. The last third was pretty abysmal."
101,Knock at the Cabin,Waste of a premise,4,"I read the book this film is based on before watching it. The Cabin At the End of the World was a great book that really dives into the histories of the characters, the philosophy behind the choice, and it ended with an ambiguous ending, where you weren't sure who was right at the end.The movie was on par with The Last Airbender in how it took the source material and made a Wikipedia summary adaptation with poor dialogue, acting and an ending that missed the point. The only redeeming quality was Dave Bautista's performance. He really did a good job with the role of a giant with a heart of gold, who is forced to do something horrible. You can really see the sadness in his eyes, and his conviction that what he saw was true.M. Night needs to get help with his scripts. He just doesn't know what he's doing."
102,Knock at the Cabin,"Knock, Knock at the Cabin. Who's There? Strangers Telling You It's the End of the World. No, Thank You, We Don't Want Any!",5,"Okay, Streamers, I know we all have been waiting on pins and needles for M. Night Shyamalan's next feature film, and it's finally here. Oh, was that only me? Okay, then... Anway, I was anticipating Knock at the Cabin since I saw the first trailer last fall. Home invasion and the end of the world movies build on reasonable fears that many people have, so let's see what Shyamalan was able to do with the mix of these two.Knock at the Cabin is based on a novel by Paul Tremblay, ""The Cabin at the End of the World."" Shyamalan and his co-writers have adapted that novel into this movie. The basic premise is that a gay couple and their adopted daughter are on a vacation in a remote cabin in Pennsylvania when four strangers come to the cabin and tell them that the world will end unless they decide to sacrifice one of their own. It's a moral dilemma - kill someone you love in order to save billions of people you don't even know. What would you do if these hijinks ensue.Here's the thing - the premise of this movie is very interesting. It immediately makes the audience question what decision they would make and what questions they would ask if put in this situation. In that way, the movie easily grabs you. The problem is that Shyamalan doesn't do much more than pose the question and go through the motions of telling you what these guys do. It gets repetitive and there isn't enough development of the gay couple as characters to help the audience care about them or why they make the decisions they make. Therefore, the movie becomes pretty frustrating and unsatisfying.On the other hand, there are some good aspects. Dave Bautista, who plays one of the strangers, Leonard, is an inviting presence on screen. He can be menacing by his sheer size, but his performance ably fights against first impressions. Rupert Grint, who play another stranger, Redmond, brings a bit of dark humor. He's probably the scariest of the strangers. I'll also mention that even though I don't believe they are well-developed characters, Ben Aldridge and Jonathan Groff, who play the gay couple, Eric and Andrew, have good chemistry and react appropriately in this situation. I'll also say that no one does anything really dumb in this movie, which typically happens in these home invasion movies. Eric and Andrew, generally, make smart decisions to help protect each other and their daughter. So, the movie isn't frustrating because anyone is dumb.I also don't know why this movie is rated R. There isn't really any gore. There isn't anything visually scary about it. There may be some curse words, but I can't imagine they were enough to justify this not being PG-13.In conclusion, Knock at the Cabin is a decent entry in the Shyamalan filmography. It is not one of his best, but it also certainly not one of the worst. There is a good premise, but the movie doesn't do anything more than present it as a morality play, which eventually becomes repetitive. Although there are good performances, there isn't enough character development to sustain interest in these individuals. Knock at the Cabin is only good enough for a handful of popcorn - there's no urgency to see this in a theater."
103,Knock at the Cabin,"Not just a knock, but another bang in the Renaissance of the enigmatic yet polarizing M. Night.",8,"Shyamalan gets the most extremes sides far as reactions. People either love or hate his movies for his bizarre yet ambitious signature style. The fact that he approaches his films with a ""swing away"" attitude has gained my utmost respect since his mega hit Sixth Sense. Along the way there's been some strikeouts but within the last decade he's created a Renaissance for his films.This particular book adaptation is yet another hit, and will be sure to get people talking. The premise starts out rather straightforward and you quickly find out the stakes are high and massive. The story will grab hold of you and shake you to the core with twists that even though you know are coming will still be shocking even for M Night's catalogue.The acting is absolutely next level with Dave Bautista and Jonathan Groff putting in their raw emotions and prowess into every scene. They will make you feel the story relentlessly . The writing here is also relative and gutsy. The camerawork is as crisp as ever with fantastic wilderness settings and supreme angle work. The cgi for certain scenes used looks authentic and never cheap. The true standout has to once again be the leaps that the plot takes going into to daring territory . It never holds back which is commendable in a time like this.Overall I would easily say that this film will be looked at as one of his stronger ventures and is highly thought provoking to a point where you'll need a second viewing. It gives the classic Shyamalan wonder and curiosity that make him one of the most intriguing directors /story tellers of our time."
104,Knock at the Cabin,Pretty good film but a shame about the ending,7,"In a world of sequels and IP M. Night Shyamalan continues to give us interesting and original stories. And he tends to get a lot of flack for them sadly. People want original content but then destroy it every time it comes along. It's no wonder we can't have nice things. 'Knock at the Cabin' isn't perfect, but it's certainly a fun ride.The film starts out as a mystery. We don't know what is going on and everything seems very strange and is not making a lot of sense. It's a good way to start a movie. Then we are let in on what is going on and things become particularly interesting. It's at this point that you simply must turn your brain off to logic to get through the rest of the film. Because much like a lot of religion it doesn't make a lick of sense.Where the film let me down was the ending. The book has such a thought-provoking and interesting ending. To get the movie made they were obviously told they would have to change that. It's very disappointing but it's sadly where we are in the world of film. Everyone is afraid they might offend the 1% so the 99% miss out.Still though, the first 9/10 of the movie are a pretty damn good time and are well worth your dollar. 7/10."
105,Knock at the Cabin,Snore At The Cabin*,3,"Having saw previews of this one, I wasn't holding my breath on it being good given who the film was written & directed by.The film sees 2 Dads who are holidaying at a cabin during the summer with their daughter until they're taken hostage by armed strangers who demand that the family make a choice to avert the apocalypse before it's too late.I found the film to be pretty mundane & boring. I mean, like most of M. Night Shyamalan's films, their too out there, slow & pretty boring. This film is no exception. The plot is simple the twist you could sort of see coming a mile a way & the action was very sparing & too few & far between.The pacing is bad, nearly 45 minutes in I looked at my watch. At 94 minutes, 1 hour & 34 minutes, this film is overly long for what it is. I also found the modern day sniping to be unnecessary along with the films underlying cryptic message about sacrifice. The repetitiveness got annoying & didn't once forward the plot or give us any idea on how the film was going to end.Overall, another horror that falls flat on it's face. Can't we just have decent straight forward horrors with no modern day drivel added in? Not to mention a film that doesn't have a weird plot with poor pacing & a off runtime? I don't know. The film didn't cut it. It was too slow, boring, mundane & repetitive & the ending wasn't that great & very anticlimactic.3/10."
106,Knock at the Cabin,Tame and mild,2,"Tame and mild are not words I would use to describe any other Shyamalan movie. I don't understand why he takes this route with Knock at the Cabin. It's not restricted by a PG-13 rating like so many other horror movies from cowardly/greedy studios (looking at you M3gan). So why were there numerous times where this movie used strategies seen in PG-13 horror flicks? Every time there was anything close to violence or gore, the camera cuts away. I don't even know what caused this to get an R-rating.As for the movie itself, it's extremely boring and has very little of value. Nothing stands out. Nothing impressed me. The filmmaking is more than competent, but there is almost no intrigue in this story. And it's one of the preachiest movies I've seen in a long time.As someone who's been more patient than most with Shyamalan's flops, that patience is starting to dwindle. I'll always be grateful for movies like Unbreakable, Split, Signs and many others. But I hope he can get back on track soon. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/2/2023)"
107,Knock at the Cabin,Judgement Day,6,"M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin is a solid concept and is filled with thrilling suspense, however I just felt that there was something missing. The acting was particularly good with some breakout performances from Ben Aldridge and Kristen Cui. It was an aesthetically pleasing film which was also a plus, but it was the story that just didn't add up. I felt that I left the movie with more questions than answers and an overall feeling of un-fulfillment. I think that audiences will enjoy this film for the most part, but the potential for a more satisfying conclusion will leave viewers feeling disappointment in my opinion. Still worth watching though."
108,Knock at the Cabin,Maybe the end of the world will not come but this movie feel like an apocalypse,5,"The last productions of Shyamalan really disappointed. This one dont do the exceptions sadly. What happened to that man who tried some things pretty original in term of cinematography, story and characters? This one feel like a waste of a time from beginning until the end. The story dont make any sense, the characters too and the writing fell apart. We have also the flashback that seem to give us a perspective of these two mans who adopted a young asian girl. I dont really felt the struggle of these two mans and find the flashback unnecessary and useless in term of the story and just give us a break in the action or an emotional moment. So the apocalypse is supposed to come and we saw that four people attack the young couple and made them forced to do a sacrifice to save the world. And for the entire movie it will be a try to escape, believe them? Or not? The movie dont have anything else to say. The psychology of the characters are completely gone and thats pretey unusual with Shyamalan. And at the end they will save the world by a sacrifice. That was pretty boring and hard to believe: it completely have non sense at all from the beginning until the end. The characters react pretty strangely ( the mentions of visions, make people believed them). I didnt get into the story from the beginning until the end. I dont know why people said it had a twist in the movie: i didnt see anything like this (we just understand that the four people were right about the apocalypse and the sacrifice). I didnt really understand the purpose of this movie at all. It was a huge disappointment for me."
109,Knock at the Cabin,This Movie Represents a Stagnating Shyamalan,5,"Knock At the Cabin is...an interesting movie for me. It's a movie that feels simultaneously too long, too slow, and too short, too quick. To me, it's nowhere near as good as Split, The Visit, or even Old.It's has the most abrupt start of any movie I've seen in recent years. Literally starting where the trailer starts, and it's extremely jarring. By the end of the movie, I wondered why Shyamalan made this bizarre decision. Oh, don't worry, this movie has the odd directorial choices, strange dialog, and weird performances, as most of his films do.But speaking of performances, Knock has some of the best I've seen in a Shyamalan joint. Bautista is absolutely fantastic in this; he's a weird looking and sounding guy. He fits these odd roles better than say, The Rock or John Cena would. And he excels here. Jonathan Goff is really, really good too. Maybe the best performance I've seen from him.The rest of the actors are okay, I guess. Rupert Grint is here and he's quite distracting. The little girl is...well, I found she spoke more like an adult than a child, a common problem in Shyamalan films.The thing about this movie that baffles me is that despite its interesting premise, it doesn't really do much with it. It's a really self contained film, but I honestly felt it needed more. Perhaps a 10-15 minute scene outside the cabin to introduce the characters? Maybe other people (cops, family) concerned about them? Something to give the movie a bit more narrative complexity?It also follows the same formula as Split and Old, with flashbacks doing a lot of heavy lifting, narratively. Yet, it's missing that special Shyamalan flair that those films had and I really enjoyed. It sorta ends how you'd expect it to end.All this sounds like I really hate this movie, but I don't. It's got cool ideas, I think it actually had a homosexual couple that felt like they needed to be homosexual for the story (not necessary, but cool), and I found it kind of sweet at the end. I also thought there were some cool visual moments, and snazzy camera work, but I felt it needed this to prevent it from being totally listless at times.I can't help but feel Shyamalan is sticking to a formula: a lower budget, confined film with lots of flashbacks and (sometimes) based on a little known property. Weirdly, this movie could've used some of this colorful weirdness. Dare I say, I miss the old Shyamalan."
110,Knock at the Cabin,Why oh why did they change the ending?,4,So the film follows the book fairly literally. The horror is more intense in the book but I can accept that. The acting is fine. The book has obviously a lot more philosophical depth but that is hard to convey in a film.But why oh why is the ending changed to some feel good happy ending?!?!? The book had a nice open ending where they walked off into the forest and you didn't know if ithe end of the world stuff was real or not and that was just fine. Why does everything need to be Disney-fied these days? Can people really not cope anymore without happy endings that books need to be rehashed to make the masses feel good. Disappointed.
111,Knock at the Cabin,Cabin believer?!,5,"This film is very M. Night Shyamalen! It reminds me of a mesh match of Josh Whedon's Cabin in the woods & the Happening. Four strangers (Leonard, Redmond, Sabrina & Adrienne) find a same sex couple, Eric (Johnathon Groff) & Andrew (Been Aldridge) and their adopted child, Wen (Kristen Cui) & asked them to make a decision that may or may not determine the fate of the world! The concept is decent enough and I was waiting for the twist ending...The cast is decent; Dave Bautista & Rupert Grint may be the most recognisable. But I have to praise the young actress Kristen for giving a convincing performance. I guessed on the off set that the 4 strangers were the manifestation of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Eric and Andrew are captured and encouraged to make said decision. Their refusal is met by a demise of the strangers one by one.. The complete ignorance of Andrew despite of seemingly predictions coming true makes him very irksome, selfish and annoying character. The ending leaves us waiting for a twist. In typical M. Night. Shyamalen's style he fails to stick the landing yet again."
112,Knock at the Cabin,Knock knock. Who's there. Cabin.,7,"Cabin who? Ya, it's all I got, and that's about as exciting as M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin. The premise of the story was very intriguing, and the casting and performances - especially Bautista, were spot on. But Shyamalan's execution felt more like something you'd expect from an amateur filmmaker. His artistic attempts with all the off-center shots - such as an actors face in the bottom right corner of the entire screen, became annoying fast, especially when it came to the dramatic gore scenes, that seemed to be edited down for 10 year old viewers. Even the backstory of the two dads was boring and pretty much insignificant to the core premise of the film, especially when the narrative was based on ""pure love"". Ya, ok, nothing pure about those two in those backstories, that also lacked anything of substance to make me care for either dad. His screenplay lacked the creativity to give the viewer the thrills and shock-factor this film really needed to give it some bite. At least throw in a twist or two to offset the generic and predictable storytelling. Nevertheless, still a decent one-time watch, but could've easily been so much better."
113,Knock at the Cabin,What Walt's Watching,7,"""Knock At The Cabin"" just continues to back my theory that nothing good ever comes out having a a cabin especially in the woods.Time after time I've been proven right ever since ""The Evil Dead"" in 1981 and again in 2011 with the biggest parody of this genre from ""The Cabin In The Woods"" also Stephen Kings' ""Geralds Game"".The king of the twist is not Chubby Checker its Director M. Night Shyamalan is back on the big screen for the first time in 2 years.His last outing had people ageing rapidly on a tropical beach in ""Old"" and now four strangers commit a home/cabin invasion during the middle of a global catastrophe.If you had to choose between saving your family or saving humanity. What choice would you make?That's the moral dilemma two ""Daddy's"" have to make when confronted by 4 strangers: the massive Dave Bautista as educator ""Leonard"", ""Servant"" actor Rupert Grint as reformed drunk Redmond, Nikki Amuka-Bird as nurse Sabrina and Abby Quinn as cook ""Adriane"" and all carrying roughly fashioned weapons.What choice or sacrifice would you make if push came to shove?Shyamalan has has been busy making the exceptional ""Servant"" for Apple Plus TV...which is must watch viewing if ""Rosemary's Baby"" is your jam.His latest feature film is also worthy of your watchlist.Some of the clues to this new twist lie in the numbers of invaders and the predictions they make.Sunday Bible study graduates will crack the so-called twist in a New York minute...others may struggle even by the ending.The hardest thing to swallow in ""Knock At The Cabin"" is Bautista as a gentle second grade teacher, but it's possibly his best acting to date.He was cast after Shyamalan was impressed by his performance in Blade Runner 2049 (2017).""Knock At The Cabin"" is based on the 2018 novel ""The Cabin At The End Of The World"" by Paul Tremblay which inspired M. Nights' screenplay.Warning: Around the 30 minute mark you'll witness footage of a strong earthquake in the Pacific which creates a massive tsunami and may shock anyone affected by recent real life events in Turkey.Watch out for: rising star Kristen Cui as ""Wen"" the daughter of the Gay Parents skilfully played by Joanthon Groff as ""Eric"" and Ben Aldridge as ""Andrew"".""Knock At The Cabin"" is a horror, mystery, thriller that will shock you and linger in your mind long after you've left the cinema."
114,Knock at the Cabin,Eh..,6,"I don't want to bash this and I actually hate that I didn't like it more. M night shyamalan is my all time favorite writer, director, producer.. I was very excited to see this and to add the amazing cast. Johnathan Geoff is also a favorite of mine and the fact that he let him sing in this was everything. The acting over all was so great in this. Big props to the little girl as well who really shined. However most of the movie happened in one room which made some of the story drag. There wasn't really a surprise or a twist like most of his movies. Very dooms day meets religious outlooks. Wasn't terrible but didn't live up to some of the greats he has made in the past. Not even a jump scare. I love when he adds the twists or a creepiness."
115,Knock at the Cabin,Disappointing Film,4,"I was expecting this film to be be good after watching the trailer but walked out disappointed. The film starts off with a young girl Wen (Kristen Cui) being questioned by a mysterious man Leonard. (Dave Bautista) Wen gets scared and runs to the cabin where her two dads Eric and Andrew (played by Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) are to tell them not to open the door. Soon Leonard and three other strangers are banging on their door demanding to be let in. When they do get in they say that the world is about to end unless one of the parents or Wen dies. Thats the choice the family have to make who to sacrifice. The film starts well, and Dave Bautista puts in an impressive performance. Sadly, however with the film mainly being in the one room it becomes repetitive and boring. The ending is disappointing. Having read what happened in the book I can see why they didn't use that ending but it would have made for a more interesting ending. Like the film Old this was another disappointing film by M Night Shymalan."
116,Knock at the Cabin,A Great Concept Too Padded Out For Time,6,"Knock on the Cabin is a pretty straight forward film that is what it advertises itself to be. Four strangers show up at the cabin of a family of three and propose that one member must be sacrificed by another, willingly, in order to prevent the apocalypse. It's an intriguing concept and there's a lot that could be done with it. Unfortunately, Shyamalan doesn't make it all that interesting. The cast is wonderful, especially Dave Bautista, who once again proves that he has become a fine, charismatic actor.Unfortunately, the concept proves to be the most exciting thing about the movie. There's a lot of dialogue and drama here, but none of it feels all that anticipatory. It's typical musings about belief and and apocalyptic forewarnings. One thing that Shyamalan does succeed in is creating tension in spurts, using cinematography and editing that has come to define a lot of his movies. But these come in waves and it's almost always very tame. I will also say that, after a brief look at the book and how the story unfolds, it feels like Shyamalan went safe with this movie. It's neither all that shocking, nor scary. There are also a bunch of useless flashbacks that feel forced and added in to pad the film out.At the very least, there are a handful of exciting scenes that almost feel like they go hand in hand with the very seldom parts of The Happening that were actually enjoyable. I gave the film the stars I did for Shyamalan creating some legitimate tension, the acting, and the intriguing story. Unfortunately, this isn't a movie I really have much of a desire to see again. The ending is pretty predictable, which is kind of sad considering it's Shyamalan, and a lot of what happens just isn't all that interesting or surprising. That said, this is probably his best film since Split, for whatever that's worth."
117,Knock at the Cabin,like watching paint dry,1,"I am sorry but these rave reviews here and 75 people giving it 10 stars, must have seen a different film to me. There are no twists or turns, the film just keeps repeating itself. The basic premise is so stupid on of three people have to sacrifice themselves to save the world, we are given no context no idea of who has said ordained this. Is it god the devil who, and why this particular family, all the easily spotted red herrrings are here, setting up the family as a same sex family where one of the husbands has an horrific homophobic attack, he tries to lead us into a false assumption, as for the ending, the expected twist never arrived. The film just fizzles out after boring you for some time."
118,Knock at the Cabin,All of humanity has been judged.,4,"M Night Shyamalan's new outing is largely a bland affair, that tries to tick the boxes which we usually associate with the director but sadly apart from the performances, the film doesn't offer anything more. The pace is slow which again is the same with all of his films but this one is devoid of any twists. All that build up for the predictable end simply disappoints.A gay couple with their daughter are at a remote cabin in the woods on their vacation. 4 strangers show up with a crazy demand to save the world from the apocalypse. Though it is an interesting premise, the pay off is not there. The scares are zero, the intensity is missing. Despite this I have to give credit for those effective shot selection. It is not dialogue heavy, just that the scenes become monotonous soon and this one lacks standout scenes.Wait for a better Shyamalan movie continues."
119,Knock at the Cabin,I loved Knock at the Cabin! I'm the 3rd person to give a 10.,10,"M Night Shyamalan's most disturbing movie yet and regardless what anyone thinks of his films he gets riveting performances out of the actors! The only film of his that is truly rubbish is The Happening and the only other one of his that is R-Rated. Anyways about Knock at the Cabin it's so smoothly written, engaging, disturbing, memorable, and brilliant apocalypse story! I'm sure my review will get mixed vibes which is fair, I'm happy to be one of the odd ones out. The group of menacing characters were outstanding especially Dave Bautista and so were the 3 leads especially Ben Aldridge, Jonathan Groff and Kristen Cui were great throughout. I'm one of few that appreciates the way things plays out."
120,Knock at the Cabin,Unique and gripping...,9,"Back from an advance screening of M. Night Shyamalan's Knock At The Cabin, I think it'll be polarizing and nerds will say iT's NoT hOrRoR, but I really liked it. It was very intense, the action starts up RIGHT away, and crazyyy good performances by every single actor. Gold star for Dave Bautista 🌟 It pulled off a few visuals and events I've never seen portrayed in a movie and they were pretty chilling. Also had some really cool camera work and transitions. I also think the end could be taken a few different ways which I really like. Go see it, and decide for yourself what happened. For me it was one of Shyamalan's best in a long time."
121,Knock at the Cabin,I'm good at catching grasshoppers....,8,"While vacationing at a remote cabin in the woods, a young girl and her parents are taken hostage by four armed strangers.They demand the family make an unthinkable choice to avert the apocalypse. Confused, scared and with limited access to the outside world, the family must decide what they believe before all is lost.....When Shyamalan is good, he's very very good. Amazing. His first three films put him on a pedestal so high, that he was destined to fall off it. Then he hit a slump for a very long while. The Village to The Visit were some harsh times for the director, because people were obviously expecting a mind blowing twist. Every. Single. Time. And why the twists were still there, they were not as brilliant as his first three films. And maybe he will never meet those heady heights again.Knock At The Cabin veers quite close to the heights he once had, and after the decidedly dodgy Old, it's nice to see him do a straight forward thriller, which does not feature his trademark twist, which may put off a few people, but then it's adapted from a book, so he's using someone else's work again. And it's no Last Airbender thankfully.From the moment we meet Leonard, the film has this very unsettling tone, that stays with the movie right until the final credits roll, and it gets more and more tense as the film progresses. Bautista is amazing in this, and thus proves that he is the actor that Dwayne Johnson wishes he was. His Leonard is empathetic to the family, but you can see that he wants to explode at them. Every gentle word he users is overshadowed by the tension he has on his face throughout the film. He has the unthinkable job of saving the world. Why him? Why any of them.Obviously the visitors are the four horseman of the apocalypse, and their calmness makes them all the more scarier than they actually are. The weakest link is unfortunately Rupert Grant. Just because he was and always will be Ron Weasley, and you cannot take his character seriously.The news casts are like an end of level boss for the most depressing video game ever, and they hark back to classic Shyamalan. You cannot help but think of the Alien news flash in Signs when you see the devastation, especially the scenes involving aircraft. You also get the obligatory director cameo, but it's very insignificant to the film work it's narrative.It's a really good return to form for the director. It looks great, the cast are great, and the feeling of dread makes the film just that little more claustrophobic.And Bautista looks like a jacked up Alan Sugar."
122,Knock at the Cabin,Shyamalan! Stop Making Movies!!,1,"Oh my god! How this ridiculous C grade movie got financed is beyond me. Is there a race to the bottom for M Night Shyamalan?Four folks show up at a gay couple's cabin to inform them they must chose someone to sacrifice in their family (they have a little girl) or else all of humanity will die. The whole film is them talking with this couple.There is nothing scary, suspenseful, thought provoking or interesting in this film. I multitasked in order to watch this garbage otherwise I wouldn't have made it to the end. I felt nothing. Not one emotion. Other than shock at this appalling excuse for a film."
123,Knock at the Cabin,A Knock in the Head,1,"Let's face, it at this point, Shylaman had been a hack for over a decade. This movie isn't esoteric, it's not misunderstood and it's not unique. The only thing Unique is the fact it was produced rather than simply throwing this pathetic screenplay into a furnace. Truthfully, outisde of a Sixth Sense and Split, Shylaman can simply not write a decent movie. You'll see the same fan boys that somehow gave Old a 10 singing the praises of this poorly written script. If you want to waste 2 hours of your life, fight off sleeping and waste fifty dollars to prove you're right. Be my guest, I was more fulfilled staying home and watching Sponge Bob reruns."
124,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Fantastic,10,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart."
125,Everything Everywhere All at Once,best film of 2022,9,"Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once."
126,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen,9,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).Grade: A."
127,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Don't remember the last time I disagreed so much with both critics and audiences,3,"I won't get a lot of likes here. Really stupid concept. Absolutely annoying frenetic style. Acting was way over the top. Did not work for me one iota. I cannot remember another movie that scored over an 8 on IMDB that I did not at least enjoy. Full disclosure, I only watched 70 minutes and decided I was way done with this film. I give it 3 stars for not being run of the mill ."
128,Everything Everywhere All at Once,To Bagel Or Not To Bagel...,3,"It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.Well, I couldn't get into ""Crouching..."" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like ""2001"" and ""Ratatouille"" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all."
129,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Disappointing: more style than substance,4,"Evelyn Wang and her husband Waymond run a laundry. Times are tough and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some niggle with their daughter and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?The plot summary for this movie intrigued me immensely: the idea of exploring how things might work out if you'd plotted a different course or, more broadly, the idea of parallel realities. The actual product, however, is far less engaging or coherent.The lack of engagement begins immediately. The Wangs' everyday life is a manic, unfocussed existence and just following this for the first 20 minutes or so was fairly annoying. It doesn't get any better once the multiverse concept is introduced, this just being an excuse for random detours and well-choreographed but meaningless action scenes.It's like a typical pretentious concept-driven sci fi/fantasy movie: paper over the lack of plot with a concept and developments that are so radical and in-your-face that viewers are fooled into thinking there's something clever there, when there isn't. Then, to make it seem even more important, have the movie go for 140 minutes when 100 minutes would have been sufficient.Every now and again there is a profound moment but due to the preceding scenes being all empty random action there's no context and the impact is diluted.Disappointing."
130,Everything Everywhere All at Once,A Pointless Bucket of Tedious Sophomoric Visual Metaphors,5,"Visual Orgy of Visual Metaphors That Get Old Well Before Film Ends. So disappointing, and the film doesn't live up to the hype. First half has some engaging moments, where it could have wrapped up without ""explaining"" what we already knew. I don't need a primer to explain the content and themes of a film thank you very much.Could of been so much better, but film fails to rely upon the intricate visuals so painstakingly laid out, deciding we needed explanation of the filmmakers' intent instead. Such a hedge essentially ruined this film - it is awkward and runs about 45 minutes too long. Nice effort visually - my rating id higher than I feel it should be, but the visuals were often witty, so...5.Overall, I had to force myself to see entire film, and it was painful. I feel cheated out of ""what could have been."" Perhaps one Director would have made a difference. Don't know. Won't ever know. It's a self-indulgent mess. 💣"
131,Everything Everywhere All at Once,The most original film ever made. Period.,10,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again."
132,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Overhyped and Overrated Bad Trip,1,"I watch and re-watch a lot of movies per year as a hobby (no money involved), and today I have 9988 reviews in IMDb. Last month, I received an email from IMDb listing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as one of the Top-10 movies of 2022. In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brail): ""Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo Tempo"" (""Everything Everywhere All at Once"")"
133,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Why the Acclaim?,5,"This one is a meh film, someone's alternate idea of multi-verse sci-fi and ""how do we script things to get Michelle Yeoh doing martial arts again"" ? A long, long way to push a theme about LGBT acceptance. The anal plugs and dildos were just odd and a strange inclusion. Some of the characters were outright annoying such as the daughter and the various minions. The hubby was OK as he smoothly switched personalities. Good old James Hong still with us, always recall him as ""hey that guy..."". Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the IRS Auditor hamming it up. And Yeoh going through the paces, looks like a bit of a payday for her. All in all certainly not one of the better films of the year."
134,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"""I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel.""",4,"Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:Be kind - even if my review isn't."
135,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Absurdly overrated,6,I get the movie but why is it every time a strange movie gets high ratings.. I think it's because most people don't understand it yet they don't want to look stupid by saying they don't. Watch the movie when it's free but don't waste $20 to see it or you'll be deeply disappointed.
136,Everything Everywhere All at Once,It would have been kinder if the reviews had been more honest about the content of this film...I may have skipped it.,1,"This was a long and unnecessarily complex film to get you the message that life and people are messy and you should accept them for who they are. I would have preferred a more straightforward story telling and I could have done without all of the body humor...putting things forcibly in one's anus, ball gag humor, hot dog fingers, eating buggers, etc. I didn't even find that type of humor amusing as a child.The only scene I even remotely enjoyed in this film was the straightforward scene towards the end of the film when Evelyn and Waymond are not together and he explains that he knows she thinks he is weak, but he is fighting in a different way, with kindness. That short but sweet moment is in my opinion, the only redeeming aspect of this film.I have heard some reviewers rave about how this was like the best acid trip...I can't comment on that since I have never done acid and I have no intention of ever trying it, especially since as a healthcare worker I know and understand the very real dangers of doing acid. I will say that I do not watch films to experience an acid trip, I watch films to be entertained and preferably with a good story.This story essentially boils down to a struggling small business owner (laundromat), is being audited by the IRS, not having a good relationship with her husband who has decided to ask for a divorce hoping to just get her to talk about their marriage, and she has a struggling gay daughter who she is avoiding telling her father who didn't accept her marital decision about. Suddenly ta-da, she discovers that there are all these other universes that are populated with other versions of her that made different choices...like didn't marry her husband and didn't move to America. Also, she is the only person uniquely qualified to save this multiverse by tapping into skills from other universes versions. And she is saving it from the big bad who turns out to be her daughter who she created....and her ""everything bagel"".I'd say it was ridiculous, but not once did I laugh and I kind of agree with the viewers who said when they saw ""the end"" on the screen for the first time that would have been happy if that was truly the end.I am sorry. I love both Michelle Yeoh AND Jamie Lee Curtis and would really like to support films anchored by strong female characters...but this film isn't one I can get behind. (Although the message, about being kind and accepting...l am 100% behind! If you can choose to do one thing, be kind is my motto.) Along that line, I think it would be kind to recommend a different film with a ""be kind"" message...how about ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
137,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Utter drivel.,1,"In what universe is a film starring Jamie Lee Curtis with hotdogs for fingers considered Oscar-worthy? The answer to that question seems to be 'this one', Everything Everywhere All At Once having been nominated in eleven categories at the 2023 Academy Awards. I'm beginning to wonder if I've somehow slipped into an alternate reality where a film's worth is measured by how quirky, irritating and baffling it is.I believe that this film's success is down to viewers not wanting to admit that they don't 'get' it - ""It's A24, and that means it's intellectual, and if I say I don't understand it everyone will think I am stupid"". Well I think you're stupid for playing along.So what's the film about? Well, Michelle Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, who discovers that the universe is made up of infinite parallel realities, each one different, and that an evil force is attempting to... ah, who am I kidding? I can't sum up this film. I tried to follow the plot, but there's so much random crap crammed into the excruciatingly tedious 139 minutes, all edited so as to induce a migraine, that I soon found myself struggling, not just to understand the plot, but to stay watching till the end.I get that the film is attempting to say something profound about life -- being happy with the choices that we have made, having no regrets, and accepting others for who they are -- but it's hard to give a toss about any of that when faced with such relentless codswallop.Rant over, I'm off to try and find a universe where this film doesn't exist."
138,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Absolutely bonkers , and not for me",3,"Beautifully filmed and everyone hamming it up . Started up promising but then I completely lost the plot....
I was prepared to give it a chance and watched it till the end ....urghh unbearable in parts ...couldn't wait till it finished .Yeah yeah I get the message love can be found in even the worst situations no matter how desperately bad or bleak .Michelle Yeoh great and Jamie Lee Curtis a real treat - she made it tolerable .Not for me am too old ,...or not old enough !Why do I need 600 characters to post ? Unbelievable............................................................................................................................................"
139,Everything Everywhere All at Once,RUN if you can help it,1,"This maybe the worst movie experience I've had in a theatre in long long time. I really can't remember the last time I watched a movie until the end and feeling utterly dejected without walking out--the closest is one of the more recent superhero movies (Avengers). Both titles have received high praise both from critics as well as audiences--but I did not connect with either of them. Clearly I am not the target-audience--I have little patience for films that claim to be ""smart"" by the sheer amount of confusion they cause--but a movie hailed by many as ""nearly perfect"" is hardly watchable.For most of the first 30 min, I felt assaulted by the sheer barrage of sounds and visuals which made very little coherent sense. I was wrong. In the next two hours, the film showed me I was an idiot--the first 30 min was the better part actually. As the movie went on, my sense of assault and confusion only increased. I constantly asked myself, ""when would this end?"""
140,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Don't do drugs, watch this instead.",9,"If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air."
141,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Comparing to PARASITE, yes this movie is indeed overly hyped and rated",1,"People usually say, ""overhyped"" or ""overrated"" if a movie doesn't live up to a fame. Sometimes it's agreeable, but oftentimes it's hard to agree with them because many claims with baseless information like the one with Titanic. How many people can really agree with someone saying ""Titanic is overrated""? Well, today I'll make a point of why Everything Everywhere All at Once is overrated with a nutshell information by comparing with the move, Parasite. When Parasite was getting popular in US, I was thinking, ""it's probably because it's leveraged by a social trend"". However, ""Boy, was I wrong"" that's what I said right after watching the movie. I could understand why it gained so much popularity. The movie is well scripted and well directed, but most of all, it's a movie that nobody has ever seen before which is probably why the movie received a big applauds and awards at Cannes and others. It's understandable completely that Parasite is definitely not overrated. However, in case of Everything Everywhere All at Once, it's also well scripted and well directed, but the plot and EVERYTHING in this movie is something I've seen in many movies and TV shows over and over especially with multiverse and the family dynamics. There's ZERO wonder why it didn't get any attention from Cannes, and the movie is basically unknown in other countries except US. The movie's fame is only leveraged by the social trend only in US. I can expect this movie will grab a lot of Oscars, and also can expect this movie will easily be forgotten unlike Parasite.*Keep in mind that I'm not a diehard fan of Parasite. I do like the movie, but I'm only using it because it makes a good comparison with Everything Everywhere All at Once especially with Cannes award."
142,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Highly Overrated,5,"Not the popular opinion, but this one is another disappointing multiverse outing.Unlike Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness, this one received overwhelming positive reviews which was the very reason for me giving this movie my time. But it turned out to be a dud. It took me to the verge of giving up after the first hour, and thought it might get better but alas not. Performance wise cheers for Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. Other than that, it's silly and takes you on a skippable acid trip.Bottom line: Definitely not worth the hype. Watch it without any expectations and you just might like it.Watch it on Amazon Prime Video."
143,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Way overhyped,6,"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though."
144,Everything Everywhere All at Once,The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!,9,"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!"
145,Everything Everywhere All at Once,What a perfect title for this movie.,9,"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on."
146,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Not very much, here.",2,"First of all if you have seen this film and loved it I am sorry. I'm not dissing you, everyone has their fave things. And I'm sure some found this to be a great film.However, I tried 3 times to watch it before I finally understood what was going on. Once I did, I realised why it had taken 3 times. Basically, it's a crap film.Let me explain why it's crap.Firstly you have no clue what's coming but a couple of middle aged Chinese taking their laundry receipts to the IRS to face a bulldoggish middle aged woman who makes uninteresting speeches about their receipts is NOT interesting. Neither is the fast talk in the elevator which still does not really explain anything and I found it to be confusing.Then what is all that about a divorce? Are they divorcing? Why? What has this to do with the film?Then suddenly the security come and her husband turns into a King Fu killer taking them all down with a scarf, before IRS lady staples something (unknown) to her head and attacks them. All the while phone earpieces that glow green are chucked about and laundry woman goes is seemingly magically transported from place to place, talking about her dog and her IRS bill and her divorce.Utter, rubbish. Pure and perfect trash. I was actually irritable at not being able to see what everyone is banging on about. It's not a great film, it's an awful one. I'm sure it will end up a cult film as the worst films usually do.Please do not waste any of your life on it like I did."
147,Everything Everywhere All at Once,Poppycock,1,"All the other reviewers have said it.Dialogue: superficial, pretentious, ludicrous, trying to sound wise and philosophical but failing miserably.Acting: ok but sometimes felt like a lot of mindless reading of lousy dialogue (see above).Comedy: childish and doesn't make any sense 90% of the time.Story: going around in circles and getting nowhere. More plot holes than a sieve.Premise: done and done and over done. Some say take it lightly, but how can we when they are so serious about relationships and quantum mechanics and the universe, while in the next breath they don't seem to understand how evolution works or how sausages are made. Like I say, poppycock.A friend of mine said it has a nice message about mental health and depression. What a very subtle way to tell a story. Give the director an Oscar for most lurid movie ever. If this was a cartoon or anime or whatever you wanna call it, I'd give it a 4 for effort. But as it is, it doesn't deserve more than 2 stars."
148,Everything Everywhere All at Once,What a Mess,4,"It's been a long time since i felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end, This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately i felt frustrated, irritated, disgusted and bored all at once."
149,"Alice, Darling",The Anguish of Alice...,7,"You're with a man who's very subtly coercive, in a relationship that's vile and corrosive, playing tricks with how you think, makes you wither, narrow, shrink, this is no way to spend your days, no life to live. Time with friends gives you a chance to float, reflect, of how your mind has crashed and burned, become a wreck, with their help they catch your fall, assist the break with a large maul, evict the poison from your heart, with great effect.I thought Anna Kendrick was amazing as the mentally anguished and tortured Alice, who's fairy-tale romance had turned out to be anything but, as she finds out what friendship and love really can be, when those close truly care."
150,"Alice, Darling",In a relationship with a Narcissist,6,"Feeding on attention whether it is positive or negative, the need to control others, manipulation, blame, and the absence of empathy; such are the signs of narcissism. Alice's boyfriend Simon possesses such traits in large amounts. In a rare moment away from him and in the company of her friends at a cottage in Ontario, Alice reflects on her situation. Noticing her stress, doubt, depression, and shame, Alice's friends attempt to open her eyes to the emotional abuse. However, Simon is not yet ready to let go of his possession.While Alice is going through this emotional turmoil there is a missing teenage girl in the town. Alice observes that, ""if this girl is hurt, it is probably by someone she knows."" Alice begins to wonder if there is more to life than Simon.Since I was once married to a narcissist, I recognized Alice's plight and coping mechanisms. It was interesting to see how the character dealt with the abuse. Anna Kendrick (Alice) is in a different role from her normal comedy routines. She does a good job of portraying a character attempting to reclaim herself from someone who feeds on her soul. I wish the film went deeper in many ways, but it does an excellent job at revealing the toll that narcissists take on our lives.World premiere in Toronto."
151,"Alice, Darling",Could've been so much more,6,"The acting was phenomenal! Anxiety and trauma oozed off Anna Kendrick and the supporting casts' was no different in their roles; the antagonist gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time, but it's all he needed.While the acting was great and I enjoyed an abuse story that's not trauma porn or exploitave, the story left a lot to be desired. Before watching it I saw it only had a 90 minute run time, and thought ""seems short for subject matter."" Sure enough, the plot felt rushed and underdeveloped. The story could've been explored on a much deeper level, and the characters make choices that don't make sense. Then the entire subplot with the missing girl I kept trying to figure out its connection only to never get an answer."
152,"Alice, Darling",Has something to offer but it's too slow and simple,5,"I like the concept here of the vast difference between actual love and narcissistic control. Narcissistic personality disorder is when someone needs to control and manipulate other people to feel like they're human. They're basically lacking a soul and feed of others in a nutshell.This film tries to portray this subtle abuse by showing mostly the abused victim and not the actual abuse so most of the film is the lead female being stuck in a relationship and it just doesn't do much else. She's with her friends and not in the actual abuse for most the screen time.The ending is pretty good, but the slow first hour or so really drags. I would have like to have seen more of what created her abuse symptoms and also how she was before meeting her Narc boyfriend.Overall the acting is good, but the plot is too slow for most audiences and didn't really progress. It also is dealing with very subtle things in a very subtle way as well so it misses the mark on being an effective drama or thriller and is more just a character study. 5/10."
153,"Alice, Darling",Strong performances but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would,6,"Alice, Darling (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of friends who decide to go on a girl trip to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of the friends, Alice, has a psychological and verbally abusive boyfriend she needs to lie to, to go on the trip. She spends the entire trip scares to death he will find out about the trip. As her friends discover what's bothering her they will do their best to help her overcome her fears.This movie is directed by Mary Nighy (Traces) in her major motion picture directorial debut and stars Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Kaniehtiio Horn (Possessor), Charlie Carrick (Deep Water) and Wunmi Mosaku (His House).The storyline for this had a lot of potential and the cast is outstanding and delivers strong performances. The chemistry between the cast was tremendous and felt authentic. You could feel the anxiety oozing through the screen and the friends genuine desperation to help their friend. However, there were decisions throughout the picture by both the friends and Alice that didn't feel realistic and was frustrating. The subplot of Angela missing was under utilized, and while a metaphor, could have had a better conclusion that was more impactful and less subtle. There's a sex scene in here that's the strangest thing I've ever seen. The ending was solid but I thought they'd show more of the husbands abusive ways in an explosive climax.Overall, this is an okay movie with some redeeming elements but didn't push the envelope as far as I thought it would. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend seeing it once."
154,"Alice, Darling",Impactful,7,"I didn't know how to write all the thoughts and feelings this movie made me feel. I also thought for a long time whether it is really worth writing everything, because the whole review will not be about the movie, but about the theme of this movie. I don't want to talk about this movie from a technical point of view, because I don't think it's the most important thing in this case. Yes, I think the movie is really good, but that's probably because I found so many similarities in it and I realized that I wasn't the only one who suffered from this kind of relationship. In short, the film is about a young woman trapped in an abusive relationship, and I think this is a very important topic to talk about, because an abusive relationship is very traumatic for people and their lives. There are many people in this world who are now in toxic relationships, and there are also many people who have been in this type of relationship before.A very important point is that the film is very realistic. Of course, each person's case is different, but the whole point is abusive relationships and how being in them affects people's inner world and mental health. People feel trapped, like they have no other choice, they think that their partner is treating them badly out of love. For such people, it seems that this is how love should be, after all, just like in the movie, Simon said to Alice: ""It's you and me. It's just us."" Being in such a relationship is like losing yourself, at least in my opinion, the motif of the missing girl in the film shows exactly that. At that time you are absolutely addicted, if you go somewhere you feel guilty for not being with a partner, if you are having fun you feel guilty again for not being with a partner. When the partners of an abusive relationship are already completely attached to their victim, it becomes more and more difficult to escape from such a relationship.But that's not the case, there is a way out of all these horrible things, whoever is reading this right now and is in a relationship like this, there is a way out. There will always be people around you in difficult times who really love and want to help. In the case of the film, it was Alice's friends who helped her escape from an abusive relationship. Although at first it seems that no one understands you, that everyone else is your enemy, but the truth is completely different.Alice says: ""I know this sounds crazy, but sometimes it feels like he can read my mind"" and ""There's nowhere left that I can actually be alone."" And this is absolutely true, because people in such relationships lose themselves, forget what they really are, they can't even think logically anymore. Also, hair pulling is a very real experience caused by a very high level of stress. In fact, the movie looked so familiar that it was hard to watch.I really highly recommend this movie because it does an excellent job of revealing the main idea and raising a very important issue. Some viewers may find it difficult to watch, but the film is definitely worth watching."
155,"Alice, Darling",Mind numbing agony for the audience,1,"Alice is stuck in a relationship with her boyfriend Simon who has low professional esteem and he apparently takes out his frustrations on her. He's never shown to be violent so we must assume the mental and guilt manipulation.Her two besties invite her to weekend up at the cabin without giving away their plans to Simon. While at the cabin Alice's shackles are ripped off. Her transformation is almost complete until Simon tracks them down and tries to drag Alice back home.There isn't much to this movie except more of the toxic masculinity hyperbole we see in every piece of ""entertainment"". While the story is simple to follow the elephant in the room is the missing girl. Why in god's name did they place so much importance on this girl when there is ZERO relevance or impact to the plot?? I kept thinking they will find her in some weird elaborate twist but sadly no its just a dead end that filled up the minutes.The acting was not bad but without a good story line this was another movie you would catch on the Lifetime Channel."
156,"Alice, Darling",Not truly on point,6,"So this is a story about a woman that's in a controlling and emotionally manipulative relationship with a man. At least that's what it appears to be. And I say that because this story is so wildly unclear, and at best you're guessing. It's like they took a story, then cut out all the stuff that would explain what actually happened. And then stuffed it full of everything that happened between the stuff that happened. And rely on you to understand the plot without telling you any of the actual story.This is not a great way to make a movie. This is a great way to debut how actors can describe things with just their range of emotions, and they are amazing in that. The acting really is top notch. But the story is so bare bones, that I simply can't give it a great rating.6/10 great acting, very lackluster story."
157,"Alice, Darling",Everybody acting UNNECESSARILY weird for ninety minutes. VERY,3,"First off, it took FOR. EV. ER to get to the point of the movie... secondly, are we really sure this movie just isn't about some girl who is completely out of her mind who created her own angst?? Unless i missed something, they did a really poor job of making the boyfriend seem verbally or even emotionally abusive... matter of fact, most of the the interactions they show of the couple actually make the guy out to be fairly nice, mild mannered, sometimes affectionate and fairly thoughtful.But instead of 'show and tell' the movie tries to outline how abusive he has been to the girlfriend in flashbacks and through her recanting stories to her friends, but even then, he doesn't seem to have really done anything bad enough to merit this woman's anxiety.In one scene she tries to explain how bad her relationship is because, as she says, ""sometimes i think he can read my mind and if he can do that then there is nowhere left that i can be alone""
meanwhile, her friends are looking at her while speaking these words like she just told them he beat her with a bat.There's another scene where she's telling her friends how much the boyfriend doesn't like potato chips as she imitates the boyfriend... ""there's enough saturated fats to kill a horse. You'll regret those when you get on the scale in the morning"".Again, the friends are sitting beside her making faces to each other like, ""oh my god - this MONSTER said that to you??!!"" """"
""i wish you would have told us it was this bad"" they tell her (seriously)
and finally, they layered a backdrop of a missing girl on this little getaway for some sort of subplot that I can only think they were trying to make the viewer fear the boyfriend (?) all the while they never really give you a reason to fear the boyfriend that much at all.This is a hard pass for me. Everybody is unnecessarily weirded out for no reason."
158,"Alice, Darling",Exceptionally dull,3,"Avoid this movie and save yourself an hour and a half of complete boredom. The movie is basically just watching, waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever does. You'll watch, wait for something significant about her backstory, and never get it. Then you'll wait for that big climax, but it doesn't happen. And then the credits roll. They put more effort into making the trailer interesting than they did with the movie itself.Part of me wonders if there was something bigger planned, and they just ran out of time and money, or if this is becoming a new trend, where movies have pointless endings, as if being pointless is something new and edgy."
159,"Alice, Darling",Annoyingly dull and boring.,5,"Even at a mere 89 mins of runtime, the sloth pacing made this annoyingly dull and boring film feel like 3+ hours long. Listed as a drama-thriller, it's remarkably un-thrilling, and the drama wasn't dramatic; the missing girl sub-plot had more drama to it.Co-writers Alanna Francis and Mark Van de Ven left all the meat and potatoes off the plate and served up just some tasteless kale posing as a fancy salad. Even the subplot with the missing girl was a pointless red herring - why even write that in? To make matters worse, the writers didn't convince me that Kendrick's character didn't already have pre-existing social anxiety issues, before trying to sell me that the boyfriend is the problem, especially how she was to her so-called best friends. The entire narrative just felt undercooked and incomplete, lacking any real impactful intentions the writers had.Then you have director Mary Nighy taking already boring scenes, and making them awkward and unbelievable. The three gal's friendship was unconvincing, as was their handling of each others insecurities towards themselves and each other, so to make the audience believe they have the ability to help (or even want) the victim, was simply unrealistic and unconvincing.The only believable performance was Kendrick, as Nighy failed to properly direct the rest of her cast effectively, especially the other two girls. I respect the message that was trying to get conveyed, but all attempts to do so were too weak and contrived, and the end result fell short of any accomplished messaging.I can't recommend this, because I really would've rather watch paint dry for what felt like over three hours. It's a generous 5/10 only for Kendrick's performance, and the decent score and cinematography."
160,"Alice, Darling",Goes nowhere,3,"Nothing happens.. you keep expecting there to be some kind of escalation but it never comes. Like the missing girl, what was the significance of that other than to pose as a threat of what she could become?I was expecting a murder of some kind, it definitely sets up for that. But alas, no drama.Anna is a great actress but not even she could save this slow movie. I'd recommend you skip this one.One note, utterly depressing with no real point? I understand it's sensitive material, but the storyline definitely needed a lot of work. Give us some excitement! For those who said the ending is great... did we watch the same movie?"
161,"Alice, Darling",Abuse doesn't mean it has to be physical,10,"So here we have Alice who is in a seemingly perfect relationship on the outside.But in the inside where nobody is allowed to see she is in a emotionally and physically controlling relationship with someone who makes her feel inadequate and undeserving and molds her to his liking.She has no idea why she is physically ill and hyperventilating at the thought of upsetting her supposedly loving partner.All too real for some people and those who can't understand this kind of torture has never been in this type of relationship.Just hope you never do.The only people she can relax around and be herself are her true friends and that is only after they take away her phone so he can't manipulate her and make her feel like she is BAD unless she replies to all his texts.Her bottled up aggression comes out when she takes the ""maul"" and whacks the crap out of some logs.Alice finally comes to the realization that she isn't herself and that is because her boyfriend has changed her into someone she isn't comfortable being.She makes her decision to break free of her manipulative boyfriend with the help of her best friends."
162,"Alice, Darling",An excrutiating watch,1,"This movie drives home the pain of abuse very effectively, primarily by torturing the watcher with its unending drudgery. Viewer beware: This is not any sort of exciting thriller, there are no shocks, surprises, twists or turns to be had. The tone is miserable from the start to the finish, and the storytelling itself is virtually absent. Almost nothing happens, and everything that does is painfully slow and ultimately inconsequential. It's just another boring straight-to-video quality story about the evil man being bad, with nothing new or innovative. Kendrick's acting is decent enough, but it's not as if she's expected to do anything other than look sadly at her phone for 90 minutes. Avoid."
163,"Alice, Darling",NOT dramatic. NOR is it the least bit of thrilling. What is left?,5,"I love Anna Kendrick, the actress. She does a decent job (as always) performing her role, but...The bad: this movie is severely lacking in spark and punch. There simply isnt any TRUE to life drama. And it sure as heck aint thrilling whatsoever.More bad: the other leading actors are quite mediocre, well below average actually and that is a real bummer, because in such a personal tale about relationship, the other actors should matter, but now they unfortunately DON""T, because their acting capabilities are way below par. No chemistry. No fireworks...sigh.Not any good then? The stories dramatic arch is disjointed. It doesnt flow well. There is ""some"" drama, but so little that I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is into dramas. Kind of a sleeping pill..."
164,"Alice, Darling","Thanks to the beginning director and writers, the story unfortunately remains a bit on the simple side.",5,"Alice, Darling is a new drama thriller directed by Mary Nighy. This is the first movie she has directed and has only directed some episodes of different TV series before this.In the film, Alice (Anna Kendrick) goes away with her friends Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku) and Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) for Tess's birthday. She lies to her partner Simon (Charlie Carrick) about this. She has an uneasy relationship with Simon, in which Simon always dominantly makes the decisions for them.This lie turns Alice's time with her friends from a fun girls' trip into a precarious one. For example, Alice begins to wonder if she should go public with her problems to her friends. This can only completely ruin the fun.Besides the fact that this is only the first film that Mary Nighy has directed, this is also only the second film for which writers Alanna Francis and Mark Van de Ven have written the story. Because of the starting sides of both of them, they keep this film a bit on the simple side. Unfortunately, the message about someone who is in an uncomfortable relationship with a partner who makes all the choices is not very strong.With this film they also take their time to make it clear to you as a viewer what exactly this film is about. For example, in the beginning you first have to try to guess what kind of film you are going to see. The storytelling of the film is unfortunately a bit on the rushed side, so the film sometimes jumps quickly from scene to scene, to show some different moments. As a result, the story can sometimes remain a bit difficult to follow and the film is sometimes filled with unnecessary scenes, which have little or no value for the final ending.It also takes a while before you clearly learn about the different relationships between all the characters. As a result, the acting in the beginning of the film unfortunately does not come across very well at first. Fortunately, this changes later in the film and most actors know how to act better and more clearly. You just keep missing a clearer history of the characters, to really understand them. Due to the lack of background information and some lack of other details, the film sometimes comes across as too rushed or simple. As a viewer, this makes you wonder why the characters can't just talk about each other's problems as friends.Anna Kendrick looks good in the lead role, but this is not her best acting. She has done better acting in her other films. Kaniehtiio is also more of a TV actress and knows how to do nice acting, but does not do anything special with her role. Wunmi Mosaku plays more like the backbone of the girlfriend group, trying to balance everything between everyone. Charlie Carrick unfortunately comes forward a bit too exaggerated in his role, so that the film loses some of its credibility."
165,"Alice, Darling",Good but could have been so much more,7,"I'm not understanding all the negative reviews here but one thing I agree with them is the pace is a bit slow especially at first. And maybe some people were just shocked to see Anna Kendrick in a serious drama. It's not a thriller, more a dramatic film. For those who don't see the abuse, you must not understand emotional or verbal abuse. It's not all showed initially but as the film progresses, Alice recalls conversations which are terribly abusive and controlling. He's chipped away at her self-esteem and confidence until she's turned into something she doesn't know or like. Her friends barely recognize her but see her pain and depression. Make no mistake, Alice is a victim of abuse. She needs to get rid of this guy and never look back."
166,"Alice, Darling",A bad movie that fails to get off the ground...,3,"Another unexceptional and boring movie common in the straight to Streaming Service era. The behind the scenes interview with Director Mary Nighy and Anna Kendrick implies it was intentionally subtle but irregardless of the intent the execution was poor. The movie is full of setups that aren't acted upon. The resulting execution is a movie that never really starts.The movie plot at its core is a uninspired story about an insecure girl with a mousey personality that has her sense of self is overpowered by the stronger personality of her boyfriend. Of course Hollywood portrays it as the dudes fault as an abuser in a relationship despite never laying a hand on her or threatening her in anyway. Yet his very being and thoughts are framed as physiologically abuse.The only thing amazing about this movie was that it got made but within an ecosystem where the demand for content grossly exceeds supply by a wide margin, the formula for Green-lighting movie projects has devolved to where any sceenplay that manages to sign a known actor to a role gets made. The bar has literally dropped to a recognizable face for the DVD cover art."
167,"Alice, Darling",A compelling yet incomplete directorial debut.,8,"Anna Kendrick really does give a career-best performance as Alice, a woman in turmoil and denial over her emotionally abusive relationship. Really, the whole cast is incredible, and the highlight of this film is the interactions between the three friends as they peel back the layers of Alice's abuse.Each of the three friends has a distinct personality, clearly different set of life experience, and manner of communication. It makes it easy to connect with them immediately and understand their perspectives and sympathise with their plights as they try to both evade and help each other.The film also does a terrific job of exploring the psychology of Alice. It can be easy to dismiss people who are being abused because it's hard to understand why they don't just leave the relationship. But it's so understandable here; Alice has become so emotionally dependent upon her boyfriend who appears kind and supportive on the surface but is so needy and manipulative in his speech that he's become an emotional leech without her realising it.I loved how the film didn't make Simon out to be straight-up evil and sadistic. He's an otherwise normal guy who doesn't think anything he's doing is wrong or abnormal, but is in desperate need of a reality check. It's complex and believable.What didn't work for me is that this movie simultaneous feels too short and too long. The climax is emotionally resonant and satisfying in its own right, but it seemingly leaves multiple plot threads dangling that retrospectively feel like they were just there to kill time and didn't contribute much of meaning to the story or themes.A multitude of scenes should have either been cut or expanded upon to give more weight to Alice's precarious situation. As it is, the movie feels slow because of all the fat in the script that wasn't capitalised on.Even so, the performances and dialogue are often so compelling and satisfyingly intricate that they alone make the film worth a watch. It's a thoroughly impressive directorial debut."
168,"Alice, Darling","Alice, Darling examines abuse without exploitation.",7,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Alice, Darling brilliantly tackles the sensitive topic of abusive relationships. Alanna Francis' script stands out with a profound, respectful look into an emotionally disturbed Anna Kendrick - career-best performance - but also into the genuine best of female friendship.A non-exploitative look into how psychological violence can be as traumatic as any other kind of physical abuse, as well as how insanely difficult it is to leave such a toxic relationship.Mary Nighy cannot escape the subgenre's formulaic boundaries, but she should be proud of such an enlightening, impactful feature directorial debut.""Rating: B+"
169,"Alice, Darling",This movie is a waste of talent and time,2,Anna Kendrick gives a great panicked performance that shows a range from her usual quirky roles. I expected so much more from this movie In the movie they show her on a trip with her friends hiding out from her abusive boyfriend. She learns how to sue an axe to chop wood. They hint that she likes swinging the axe and it feels good so I assumed that was going to be the ending. I was looking forward to the killing of the boyfriend but instead they just split up and that was the end of the movie. This was 2 hours of nothing and wasted potential.Like I said I wanted to like this because I like most of Anna Kendrick's movies. She was the executive producer and I think she should have pushed for more risks in this movie because its a glorified Lifetime movie.The boyfriend is portrayed as a rapist and sexual abuser and there is no consequences to this. They just break up so he can go do it to someone else. Skip this movie if you have the chance. I am also a man so maybe with women they connect with it more but as a man who likes rom-coms etc this movie was a terrible slog to get through.
170,"Alice, Darling","Powerful, subtle, poignant",7,"Loved this movie and a great debut for director Mary Nighy. The film creates a real sense of what it must be like for the abused party when the abuser is a controlling, manipulator. There were Great performances too from The three main characters who demonstrate the spirit of friendship as the became increasingly aware of what was really going on. It just goes to show that a psychological drama does not need to be extreme or violent and that the damage and trauma of control and manipulation can be subtle and unseen.It's a mystery to me why the early reviews on IMDB have been so negative about this movie."
171,"Alice, Darling",quiet suffering,7,"Alice (Anna Kendrick) is stressed. Her boyfriend Simon (Charlie Carrick) is controlling. Her friends Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku) invite her to spend a week at a cabin in the country. She becomes obsessed with a missing woman.This is a classy indie version of a Lifetime movie. Whereas Lifetime would have the boyfriend scream and turn the climax into a thriller chase film, this one is showing the emotional control and quiet suffering. It's not the most dynamic, but it works. I do want a moment of standard melodrama and have Sophie force a hug on Alice. This movie needs a heavier hand in a few key moments. Anna Kendrick is pretty good here. The actors are all pretty good."
172,"Alice, Darling",A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Exploration of Abusive Relationships,9,"A powerful and thought-provoking drama that delves into the complexities of an abusive relationship. The film, directed by Mary Nighy and starring Anna Kendrick, is a raw and unflinching look at how easy it can be to become caught in the undertow of a bad romance.The plot of the film centers around Alice, a young woman who is in a relationship with Simon, an abusive partner. The film follows her struggles as she tries to navigate her relationship with Simon and the growing concern of her friends, who can see the red flags of his behavior. The film is well-written and thoughtfully directed, with Nighy balancing perspectives in a way that feels genuine and authentic.The acting in the film is top-notch, with Anna Kendrick delivering a stunning performance as Alice. Kendrick's portrayal of a person who is overwhelmed by the pressure of an abusive relationship is both heartbreaking and powerful. She is able to communicate the character's struggles with a range of reactions, from catatonic vacant stares to succumbing to heaving waves of a panic attack on the bathroom floor. Her performance is a departure from her usual bubbly screen presence and a testament to her acting abilities.The cinematography in the film, by Mike McLaughlin, is also noteworthy. The film has a distinct visual style that effectively captures the murkiness and isolation of Alice's relationship. The world in which Alice lives looks a little less bright than that of her friends, adding to the sense of isolation and disconnection.The only downside to the film is that it tries to add an element of danger to the story through a subplot about a missing young woman. While this subplot is intended to add a sense of urgency to the story, it ultimately feels like an unnecessary complication.Overall, ""Alice, Darling"" is a must-watch film that tackles the difficult subject of abusive relationships with sensitivity and nuance. The film's performances and direction are outstanding, and it is a powerful and thought-provoking piece of storytelling."
173,"Alice, Darling","Shallow - more shallow - Alice, Darling",5,"Without a doubt, abusive relationships are an extremely important subject of our time. If sophisticated and served with the required depth, even movies might clear things up and maybe even change things for the better. Sadly, this is not the case here. This movie's main flaws are in it's shallowness and clearly one-sided view on a very sensitive topic:(1) All we experience is Alice's suffering and incapability to break out of her relationship. There is a victim and a culprit -- that's how simple it is presented in a strictly subjective way. But monsters are made, not born. What about her boyfriend, why is he acting like this and how did he become who he is? This would have been one of the rare cases where flashbacks would have made sense. The film totally misses the opportunity to make the audience understand the mechanics and causes of this relationship by showing both sides of the story.(2) We learn about Alice as a character who is suffering in an abusive relationship. That's it. But who and how was she before she met him, why did she fall in love with him and how did she change? It would have been a much more emotional impact, if the audience would have been able to compare her former self to the current situation.(3) In an abusive relationship, there are only victims -- meaning the abuser is also suffering. Since her boyfriend suffers from personality disorder, he's a sick person. How does he suffer, what about his other relationships to friends etc.? Did he made some efforts to get healing? There's nothing like that in here, because that would not fit his awfully simplistic role: The evil torturer.(4) Making a movie about mental health issues bears a great challenge: You have to explain it properly to the audience -- otherwise it will be misunderstood, with all the after effects. Not everyone, who criticizes his partner, likes a certain haircut on him or needs his confirmation from time to time, is a narcissist. This movie fails here completely and serves every wannabe psychologist very well.Without a doubt, due to it's simplified and one-sided approach this movie will surely comfort a certain part of the audience. Anyone else, who is rally interested in this matter, will most likely be disgusted by it's shallowness. I don't think it was the intention of the creators but if you see it in the most negative way, this movie is sexistic even. A female abuser would have made it more interesting but here it's a white male in his 30s. Guess what.Nevertheless and despite the several deep flaws in it's storyline etc., the movie is well shot. Acting is decent, especially Wunmi Mosaku and Charlie Carrick do a great job. I give 5/10 stars, because it's technically well done and picks up an important subject -- though it could tell it's shallow story in 30 minutes."
174,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Lots of cringing moments.,2,"The concept is the only decent thing about the film. The acting, visuals, dialogue & execution is just horrid. Many moments where common sense & logic just goes out the window. Some of the problems to list: #1 most of the characters are just bland; only the slutty/preppy one has any sort of character to herself. #2 The Christopher character is just annoying with half his dialogue being an hysterical ""why you doing this"". #3 One of the female group characters discovered their friends corpse outside notices the windows covered in blood saying something and she states ""it has to be the same people""... no its the pizza delivery guy (sarcasm).... I don't think anyone is THAT stupid to put 2 & 2 together to need to have that verbally stated... perfect example of horrid writing. #4 2 of the girls unties another woman they discover who digs out a gun to go after ""Piglet"" ends up shooting off a shot to get his attention then tries to shoot again just to run out of ammo, right after that happens ""Winnie"" is behind her for the kill..... The 2 girls are watching this all go down yet never warn her?!?!"
175,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,I think some people have misguided expectations,4,"Blood and Honey is not a good movie. It's poorly written, there are some directorial shots that would never make a movie made by a studio, and there is some pretty cringe acting as well. The characters are paper-thin to the point I can't remember any names. The pacing is a bit off and the effects at times were notably bad.But what did you expect on a budget under $100,000 made by amateurs? I don't feel like my time was wasted by people who used an IP as a lazy money grab. I thought the team tried and did what they could within their means.There were a handful of cool directorial shots, a few fun kills, and some bad in an entertaining way scenes that made this at least watchable. It's a really short film that isn't an absolute chore to get through. This isn't even the worst horror film I've seen this year.If the next time around there is a bigger budget, better writing/editing, and better casting it could be fine. A lot of their issues seemed to be budget or inexperience related as opposed to offensively bad or incompetent."
176,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A Big Ol' Pile of Unfinished Pooh!,2,"This movie is not a finished product, not even close. This needed AT LEAST a month or two longer in the editing room because it is a mess! I'm not even talking about the terrible story or acting because I knew I was getting that regardless, which is no problem for me as long as there's some carnage. I'm talking about the atrocious sound mixing/editing, the abrupt cuts and transitions, and nauseating camera work. The basics of filmmaking! Whenever someone is getting murdered, you can't even tell what is going on because the camera work is so amateurish and shoddy. It's almost like the camera operator was having a seizure whenever they were supposed to film a kill.This movie had a $100,000 budget, yet they showed almost no gore/make-up FX when someone would die. If you're filming a low-budget B horror movie, people are going for the kills and not much else, therefore you better be pumping 80% of your budget into the ""horror"" aspect of the movie and show some people getting slaughtered.Terrifier 1 had a $25,000 (a fraction of Blood and Honey's budget), yet showed every kill in grisly detail and people LOVED it! Then they made a sequel for $250,000 and made 13 million off it. I'm not sure where the $100,000 budget of this movie went, but it was most definitely not the kills, editing or acting. Maybe Pooh and Piglet's costumes were each $50,000 a piece, and if so the costume designer definitely pocketed that money.The only reason I'm not giving this a 1 is because I like the concept of taking a fictional character from the public domain and putting a B horror twist on it. Though a good concept, the execution could not have been much worse. This should not have left editing room let alone released IN THEATERS! The distribution company should be held accountable. It's like video game developers releasing unfinished games. Trash.2/10."
177,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,"Stupid as hell idea, but it can be entertaining if you give it a chance.",7,"There are some cases of movies in which just by seeing the poster you have a good glimpse of what you are going to watch. There's no point in me doing a synopsis, because if for some sick reason you've ever dreamed of a movie where Winnie the Pooh (yes, the bear from your childhood) goes psychotic and on a killing spree, that's just what you're going to get in this movie.I want to clarify something, being objective this is not a good movie even remotely. As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.So why do I give it a 7? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.In short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all. If you don't find the idea of Winnie the Pooh killing people at least a bit fun, you should do well by skipping this one."
178,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A movie without much to offer.,4,"Talking about ""Winnie the Poo: Blood and Honey"" carries a lot of negativity, it's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen but it's bad enough, the script is empty and full of nonsense dialogues and incoherent actions, whose only attraction is to see two famous characters from the animation as villains. The cast tries to do their best but the way their characters were written fails to make them stand out, giving only flat performances. The make-up effects are efficient but the computerized blood that oozes from the victims is quite unreal and detracts from the gore. The cinematography in the exterior locations is the most successful as it achieves a gloomy atmosphere. A bad movie with a couple of good scenes."
179,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,A Terrible Excuse of a Mess!,1,"I like films and movies in general and horror is one of my favorite genres. Lately I've been getting into the more low budget films where the filmmakers rely on creativity over showing off the budget on special effects and past their prime actors looking to still be in movies. A lot of the ones I've seen in fact have fallen into the ""so bad it's good"" or cheesy and over the top category that you can't help but have fun because everyone involved with the film clearly was while making it!Unfortunately this is a train wreck that absolutely needed more time to be polished. The worst part about this is that you can see that there some solid foundations in some of the way the shots were setup & the premise is a decent one to build from. The problem is that this looks like it was executed by someone who is learning to make movies, which is fine, but it probably should've gotten more time in front of other filmmakers that could've pointed out the obvious flaws.One big flaw that this movie has is that the narrative is difficult to follow. Scenes that should establish who the characters and help the audience follow what is happening with them as the story progresses is non-existent. Characters literally pop in & out of thin air and things happen to them but you don't see how the story takes them from point a to b. In additions to this, the movie is impossibly dark to the point where you literally can't see anything except random things meant to represent the characters and objects they're holding or moving around! Several scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell where the characters are in relation each other or the scenery. Movies are a visual medium, you need to see what is happening or at least have an inkling of what is unfolding even if you're not supposed to see thing la clearly!The plot about Winnie-the-Pooh and the other forest animals turning feral after Christopher Robin left them to be an adult was a good starting point but ultimately went nowhere. Why did Pooh & Piglet wind up torturing or killing people if they became ravenous from hunger instead of eating them? Why is Christopher Robin just barely in the movie, while the focus is on a bunch of other characters that we literally know nothing about?Clearly you can see the inexperience of the director on display here as some scenes and shots are well done while others are absolute trash. I'm sure given enough time they will improve with more movies under their belt but they need someone to help guide & mentor them so that they can make a movie that is watchable. Sure, this was a micro budget effort but it's advertised like it has more money behind it than it really does. If this guy had a solid fundamentals I'd be complaining more about the story than how everything is presented! And the presentation doesn't require fancy cameras or special effects, you just need good clear shots and narrative flow which don't require a ton of money if given the time to do it right!Lastly, I heard that there is already a sequel in the works? How in the hell did this piece of garbage manage to get a sequel greenlit and Zack Snyder had so much difficulty getting more movies made in the DC Universe?! That tells me that somehow there is someone with money that has more cash then sense and somehow got talked into making more of this...I will definitely & absolutely NOT recommend this movie for anyone in any form! Not even if you're high or drunk, this is just a pure waste of time that you will never get back."
180,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Some horror films are so bad that they're good. This one is just bad.,1,"Let me start by saying that I went into this expecting it to be very, very bad, but sometimes that makes for a fun watch so I was open-minded. Literally the ONLY decent thing about this movie is the score; everything else, the acting, the writing, the plot, the complete and utter lack of even so much as an ATTEMPT at character development, was a complete mess. It's not one of those horrors that are ""so bad it's good"", it's just painful to sit through from beginning to end. Full of plot holes, completely lacking a protagonist, full of characters who are uninteresting and un-likeable, I can't imagine how anybody could enjoy this movie."
181,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Winnie the Pooh:Cringe and Strangely bad,2,"First of all, the movie is really bad but its badness has made it entertaining in certain aspects. The main reason for the badness of the film is the acting. It may be the worst cast I've ever seen in my life. They act so badly in every scene that it's unbelievable. The acting is a disaster and it really ruined the movie.There were 3-4 bloody scenes in the movie that looked good in the cinema, but some scenes were incredibly unnecessary and long. Also, the nudity was forced on us before the characters died. It would have been better if they had chosen the cast according to the movie's requirements.Actually, when I first heard about the movie, I thought it might be interesting. It has a low budget and a different structure. However, the screenplay that the director chose was extremely bad, which ruined the movie. Although I really liked the animation in the first part, the costumes of Piglet and Winnie were incredibly artificial and awful, which turned the horror scenes into comedy.It would have been better if it had been written much better and if it had been adapted to the screen with good costumes in a short time. Unfortunately, our director has made very bad choices and has created a disaster of a movie. He has disrespected the characters' past. There's really nothing worth watching in this movie.2."
182,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,good bloody fun,9,"If you're going into this movie expecting a multimillion dollar budget movie with an Oscar nominated script, your going to be disappointed. This has been described to me as ""a perfect experience for fans of B movie slashers"" and that's exactly what I got. I'm glad I saw the movie in theaters (Mexico City) because I had a complete blast.I think they pulled this off by being in on the joke. It almost plays as a satire of the slasher craze from the 80's. They knew they were making a Winnie the Pooh slasher and they leaned hard into the premise. I laughed, I was shocked (the deaths are all super fun and creative), and I was impressed by the cinematography and music (especially for this budget which I think is probably less than $100k). In short, it's just a good time if you know what you're signing up for.Similar to Terrifier 2, this is a super low budget horror movie getting a huge amount of attention and press and that's so exciting to me as a lifelong horror fan. I personally want to live in a world where that happens more often. So yeah I gave it two extra stars for that reason alone. They pulled off the impossible.Go see it in theaters and support true indie horror films."
183,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,What a waste,2,"If there are any ""real"" directors reading this; there is clearly an interest in a Winnie the Pooh horror. This isn't it.I don't even know where to start in expressing the sheer disappointment of this ""film"". What's worse, it doesn't appear to be an issue about the low budget - more the direction. We have all seen recently what can actually be achieved with a small budget. It would appear this ""director' got very lucky with an interesting idea, but has no idea how to actually make a film.Our cinema was about half full, but after 45 minutes I would guess half of those had left. Not because it was scary or gory or too intense - but, my guess, and along with us, bored out their minds. By about an hour in the rest of the audience had broken into conversation. We left with about 15 minutes left as just couldn't take another second.On the way out I asked for a refund (never done that before lol). The guy behind the counter laughed and said a couple others had said the same thing.So what's wrong with it? Well, first and foremost its not scary. It's also not funny or clever or interesting or well shot. It drags on and on with super bad acting, awful music, bad editing, bad camera work, dreadful lighting, terrible dialogue, super cheap looking costumes.... and I could probably go on.Sometimes bad films can be a cheesy, campy good time but the absolute killer here is - it's boring.The world of horror has some absolutely fantastic up and coming directors and its a shame someone with some talent didn't have this idea and execute it properly. But as Winnie is now public domain, maybe someone will.And, somebody needs to ban these people from ever making another film. And, I want my money back.As I was writing this review I came across a review in the Daily Beast by Nick Schager (full credit to him for the below and the full article can be found online/socials) that puts it so much more eloquently than I have been trying to:""Frake-Waterfield exhibits minimal skill at framing a unique or unnerving shot, effectively transitioning between scenes, or eliciting jolts though canny cuts or audio cues. He's not helped by Vince Knight's muddy, shaky cinematography and Andrew Scott Bell's comatose score, which loses steam at precisely the moments that is should be punctuating the action.Its difficult to fault the musicians for their lethargy, however, in light of the omnipresent amateurishness on display, almost none of which can be blamed on production constraints; though its clear that Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey was made on a shoestring budget, its failings have to do with a simple lack of talent both in front of and behind the camera.In the weeks leading up to Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey's premiere, the writer/director has expounded on his plans to film a series of additional children's lit horror shows, with Bambi and Peter Pan next in line for the grim dark treatment. On the basis of this fiasco, however, that feels like so much wishful thinking. For all of Pooh's kills, the greatest casualty of his rampage may just be Frake-Waterfield's career prospects""."
184,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Does not utilise it's premise at all.,2,"I fully expected Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey to have indistinguishable disposable characters, kills that are gross and mean-spirited, a bone-thin plot, inane dialogue, and acting that is...mediocre at best.I was right about the film having all of these things, and I didn't mind these things. They're par-for-the-course in the slasher genre, and I embrace the self-aware trashiness of it all.What I was not prepared for was just how boring this movie is. And it's because it does not even attempt to make use of its characters that should make for a slam-dunk of a hilariously enjoyable concept.Christopher Robin and his college friends should have been the focal characters. But Christopher Robin is barely in this movie and instead we get a group of vapid girls who have no relation to Christopher. They get killed off instead, and there is no reason to care because they're completely detached from the connection between Pooh and Christopher at the beginning of the film.It would have been so easy for them to capitalise on a concept that could only be found in Winnie-the-Pooh: the animals kill Christopher's family and friends as revenge for him abandoning them. But the plot we got could be interchanged with literally any other plot in the slasher genre, as it's just a bunch of randos getting killed.What also doesn't help this disaster is the awful editing. Almost every shot lasts longer than it should, and it makes each scene feel agonisingly long.It's a film where we watch a lot of half-baked ideas play out on screen, and none of them are unique. None of them are what I wanted to see from a concept as silly as this.This could have been hilariously good fun. Instead, it's identical to the rest of the trash you can find in bottom-of-the-barrel horror."
185,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Pooh!,1,"Let me make it clear that I'm not offended by the idea of a Winnie the Pooh horror movie. Such a movie isn't going to ""ruin my childhood"". However, this particular Winnie the Pooh horror is very bad. It starts off explaining how Christopher Robin found and befriended genetic freaks called Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and Owl. They remained friends until Christopher went off to college and left them to fend for themselves. Unable to find enough food, the rest of the animals killed and ate Eeyore, which led to them becoming feral and taking a vow of silence. This part of the movie was adequately done, but it was all downhill from here. The rest of the movie has two men in unconvincing Winnie the Pooh and Piglet masks going around killing people in gruesome ways. What happened to Rabbit and Owl? I don't know, they were nowhere to be found. This movie is bad, and it's way too grim to be enjoyably bad."
186,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,"""The Room"" of horror films, without all the fun...",1,"This is one of the worst films i've ever seen in my whole life... The directing, The acting, The script are just horrid. The ""gore"" is barely visible, The characters are literally actors wearing a mask, they didn't even bothered to make Winnie the Pooh or Piglet more accurate to a non-person, and neither they are scary. Don't waste your time on this Piece of sh**. It's a solid 0, but the 1 star is the lowest rate I can give at this site.I just knew the director started making feature films in 2022, which also look as bad as Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey. And also filmed another one this year called ""Firenado"", let your imagination go wild..."
187,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Do not insult 1980's slashers.,1,"Firstly I will say that I am a massive horror fan, small or big budget it doesn't bother me.Next thing I want to say is that a few of the reviews have said that this so called film is shining in a way the spotlight on 1980's slasher movies, believe me it's not in fact saying that is giving them a bad name. Most of them were of limited budget.Another thing and IMDB need to stop this, all the 8, 9 & 10 star votes are from people associated with this car wreck of a movie in one way or another.Now onto the movie itself, this one should be missed by everyone, why?Well the acting didn't bother me so much as I didn't expect much from it in the first place.This film is bad, from the story line to the 'let's get a lesbian couple in here, so people will think we are a modern film' brigade.It could have been such a great fun film and it wasn't.The death scenes were tiresome, the so called blood scenes were barely visible. Pooh and Piglet just looked as if two actors just went to a joke shop and bought some cheap masks.Will this poor attempt of a film get a sequel, I suppose it will but I won't rush to see it.Do yourself a favour and give this one a very wide berth and don't waste you time."
188,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Great for horror not meant to be taken seriously!,7,"My only problem with my experience was how 2 young girls came in 40 minutes late and one near me was constantly rude the rest of the movie, my nearest theater really needs security cause I would've contacted someone if I wasn't wanting to finish the movie and figured not much I could do. Anyways about the movie unexpectedly starts off innocent with great drawings and explains the origin of the story so well, if you void out the bad acting the horror is incredible and so is the music. Such a great cheesy movie despite any complications I still enjoyed Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey for what it is! Wild concept taken from a childhood treasure and the killers were brutal reminded me of the Victor Crowley from Hatchet films."
189,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,WTF?!,1,"The only good part about this movie was the beginning where they explained how they went feralNo Rabbit, No Tigger, or Roo...honestly, I was hoping for something that would've been a gritty telling of what happens after Christopher Robin had to leaveWhat we GOT was a forgettable slasher that didn't even care for logic, characters that are worse than the movie tropes and I didn't care for any of them at all. They were just...bland and I didn't care about them when they diedThe film is dark as in it's barely visible. Some films did it better but this one is so dark I can't see what's happening half the time. The kills are...meh, I just feel like these are human versions of turkeys with no survival instinctWhoever decided this was a good idea needs to be fired."
190,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Rhys Frake-Waterfield shouldn't be allowed to direct a movie EVER AGAIN.,1,"This is the reason why I started supporting piracy, for movies like this.Every aspect of this movie is horrendous. The acting, the storytelling, the characters, the animation, literally EVERYTHING.At this point, I think we all knew that the movie wasn't going to be an Oscar award winner, but the director utterly trying to do something decent with this movie (as he knew he was making money just because of the title) is pretty much disgusting.We had movies like Terrifier 2 which, despite of having a poor storytelling and a low budget, were fun and got us attentive to what happens next. This? This is pure trash."
191,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Silly old bear. Don't bother,3,I wanted this movie so bad to be some what decent. The beginning starts out great. Story telling. Sets things up for a decent film and then flat!The writing gets so horrible! The acting/characters outside of Pooh are horrible! I hate that this movie had so much potential and gets wasted on an awful script! For low budget cinematography was done well. The music was done well.Can they please have me write the sequel?!?Christopher Robin by far was a waste. Did the director owe this guy money?Whoever played Pooh might be able to pull off Michael Myers. Good stalking movement.Best thing about the movie was the kill scenes.
192,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Utter sh:te,3,"Great idea for a horror film, this could have been ridiculously funny and scary at the same time but the film was quite flat. I was expecting a funny slasher movie but it was dissapointedly bland, I wanted more laughs or suspense.I don't expect much from this type of genre but I think the plot could have been developed more, I found the story quite plain, they don't tell much but just a little bit at the very beginning.I appreciated that the film doesn't use the unexpected loud noise to make the watcher jump from the seat. More suspense in the chasing scenes would have been better too. I also appreciated the British accents accordingly to the story.There's no proper conclusion to the story, at the end of the film it feels like something else needed to wrap up, it just abruptly finished.Watch if curious to see Winnie the Pooh as a killer. Can't deny it was a great idea for a horror film."
193,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Worst Than Anticipated.. and I didn't even expect it to be good.,1,"So, I definitely didn't expect this movie to be good at all going in to it.. but I guess I didn't expect it to be quite as bad as it is. I was still excited for it because I love horror that's basis is twisting a happy fairy tale into something dark. This just totally missed the mark in every way though. The setup for the story was so bad, it was just a voiceover explaining the backstory, then Christopher Robin comes in with his wife and the acting is just awful. They die almost immediately so the rest of the movie is just pointless. There's no story really beyond that. All the acting is awful, the characters are lame. The villains are just two guys in masks that aren't scary at all. They didn't even try. The gore was a let down. The movie was too dark to see what was going on half the time. The sound sucked. The writing was awful. I turned it off halfway through and I almost never do that with films, despite having watched plenty of truly awful movies. I really wanted any little redeeming quality for this movie to be able to throw in here but unfortunately there's nothing going for this film. The ONLY thing that's good is the idea of twisting this classic tale. Hopefully someone else takes the idea and does it better than this crew."
194,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,You're tough. I'll give you that.,1,"Christopher Robin (Nikolai Leon) goes off to college and returns five years later. His animal friends brew hungry and had to eat some of their own. The decided never again to talk to humans and to hate humans especially Christopher Robin who left them. When Christopher returns to the 100 acre forest with his wife Mary (Paula Coiz) things don't go well as Mary as she becomes fodder. A group of young female adults go up to a cabin to unwind. These are the pretty screamers who can not run or fight that well. They encounter Pooh (Craig David Dowsett) and Piglet (Chris Cordell) and the screen turns dark and bloody.The film tried to be sexy with some tease near nudity. The creatures are men in very cheap costumes, like those Easter Bunny films. The plot was basic, too basic.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
195,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Waste of time,1,"A lot of hype over this film a HORROR version of Winnie the Pooh. The film was a waste of time. Cannot believe they already talking about a sequel!!! Low budget you can tell Pooh and Piglet
are people in masks. Bad Acting and script. I usually give a film a chance even if bad rating etc but I turned this off as was that bad There are many films out there that are terrible but this words cannot say how bad it is. There will be people that will like it and like me people that will hate it. Film had possibility but sadly his is how it turned out. Watch it or dont your choice it is a full let down."
196,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Plain boring,1,"Characters are barely characters, I was surprised they even had names. They are as dumb as you can imagine, nothing makes sense, camera angles are weird, the movie (at least in my theater) was too dark, I had flashbacks from that one episode at the last season of GOT, I could barely see anything.The deaths are not even that impressive or gory, the chasing scenes are painfully slow, im convinced this movie could have been a 30 min short.I saw a group of friends actually leave in the middle of the movie. I don't blame them, I don't know how long this was but it felt like hours, the only thing that kept me awake was making fun of it but honestly it wasn't even worth it.Its not that kind of movie that its so bad its good, this us just BAD. It feels like nobody working on this movie was excited about making it.Just so so boring, I felt like I wasted my time."
197,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Lost Potential,2,"This film had great potential to be a great film, featuring well know and beloved characters as evil villains as opposed to be sweet and harmless. The concept and the idea of it was great! Of what happens after Christopher leaves his friends for college and doesn't return for so long. But the execution of this concept was a complete disappointment.The start of the movie was promising, with eerie, 2D animation in black and white like children's drawings depicting the past of Christopher discovering the famous characters and what they did when he left, but it immediately went downhill from there within the first ten minutes of the film.The acting was poor by a majority of the actors, but it didn't help either that their written dialogue was also so empty, flat and lazy. Absolutely none of the characters were well developed enough to like, even in the slightest bit.The animated blood and gore was exciting and promising for a thriller, aiming to invoke disgust and unease, but the way in which it had been animated was done so poorly that online content creators could do better. It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't good either.The number of inconsistencies constantly left me confused throughout the movie, wondering and questioning why characters were behaving in certain ways when it made no sense, or where things suddenly came from, everything felt like such a let down.Halfway through the movie, I had posted the thought to my friend I was watching it with that perhaps this film was attempting to be a satire but was just bad at it, and they looked it up to find that this movie genuinely was a serious attempt at a thriller movie.There is simply too much done poorly for this movie that it outshines its very, VERY few positive parts. It was genuinely such a disappointment I wanted to walk out in the first ten minutes.If you watch this as a satire and don't take it serious, you'll be able to get a good lot of laughs from it. I know I did. But as a serious thriller movie, it just didn't turn out well.The idea and concept of the movie was great. With it, a hilarious satire movie could've been made, or a genuinely disturbing and bone chilling horror could've been done. But this film really dropped the ball on it."
198,Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,Loved it!,8,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be a comedy or spoof, and then I saw it was classified as a horror film. Of course I was curious and just had to see it. I didn't have great expectations but I absolutely loved it! There was a lot of people in the theater and everyone was laughing, even when somebody got killed - especially when somebody got killed - because they did such stupid things it's almost like they deserved it. It was like they were paying homage to the slasher films of the 80s. It was just so bad that it was great and if it ever comes out on DVD, I want it!"
199,True Spirit,"Inspiring adventure, script and graphics struggle.",6,"Years ago I read ""Sailing Alone Around the World"" by Joshua Slocum and I have been a solo Cape Horn groupie ever since. There were some great books including Naomi James engrossing ""At One with the Sea."" At the start the success rate of solo round the Horn was about 50%. It has improved with technology and weather data but is still a risky exciting enterprise. The sailors all seemed a little bit odd, I felt a kindred spirit. Cf ""Voyage for Madmen"", also filmed. So, I bussed down with my nearly 10 year old granddaughter to see ""True Spirit"" when it opened at Maroochydore.At the time of her voyage, I had wondered if there was some pressure on the sailor for the trip, but the more I saw of her the more she seemed to be a determined independent young lady who had her own ideas. I have been steadily impressed with her. She is not seen chasing 'celebrity'. I was however a little apprehensive about the film, as there were no reviews, - this could be one of those over-earnest paeans that the Antipodes can do. The granddaughter is a hard critic. Well, she liked it and watched earnestly right through. It does have a bit of an old-fashioned feel to it. No slaughtering superheroes or flying hedgehogs. I am glad I took her to see it.I thought it wasn't bad, with reservations. The storm scenes/CGI were a little unreal. (like in 'Perfect Storm' - graphically spectacular, but distracting) This detached me from the drama. And the general sailing was less absorbing than it might have been, though I know solo sailing isn't all excitement, it can be done. Apart from the 'over the top storms' the photography was good. The sea is a good act to watch.The dialogue often tends to be formulaic and occasionally cloying. Shame; a lot is good. Teagan Croft is excellent as Jess, she seemed to be the character. Cliff Curtis was great as the mentor Ben Bryant. Anna Paquin good as ever and generally the actors were fine. Some things I vaguely remember from the time, such as the flyover by the parents (-must have been emotional.) and the wait before the Horn, were barely dealt with but excusable in the name of good editing. At 106 minutes it was about right. Actual footage of Jessica at the end was quite moving.Sarah Spillane has avoided over adulation. There are some script failings but still very watchable reproduction of Jessica's exploits. The determination and achievement of the young sailor were recognised in the film and anchored it."
200,True Spirit,The movie lacks true spirit,5,"I watched this as I am a sailor and I was curious to see where her story fit in with Abby Sunderland, who tried the same feat at teh same age but failed after a storm in the southern ocean.As some have said I also think the film was made in a Disney style to highlight the spirit of exploration, adventure and courage. It does it splendidly and is a joy to watch for that reason.As a record of Watson's achievement though I think it falls short. The things she went through including being becalmed for a full week would have been horrifying. And the storm scenes almost romanticise storms rather than showing the real turmoil that Watson went through.It showed nothing of the struggle she would have faced sailing the boat although does touch on her loneliness. I think as a record of her adventure it was below par.I haven't read her memoir but I believe I will now to get the first hand real account, not the sanitised version from a director."
201,True Spirit,Wow! Inspiring film from down under!,9,"Just finished watching this excellent movie. It's based on a true story, so there won't be any spoilers here. It's the story of Jessica Watsonl who's always dreamed of sailing around the world by herself. She's on a quest to be the younger person to do so.As you'd expect, she certainly has her share of obstacles. But she shows the true grit needed to complete such an adventure. The film goes from her at sea, to flashbacks of her growing up and all the things that led to this amazing adventure.I thought the acting was absolutely spot on. The photography and special effects were tremendous as well. And it's full of breathtaking action scenes that make you feel you're on board with her. There's one absolutely gorgeous scene when she's caught in a dead-air zone. She stares at the night sky just full of stars with the David Bowie's ""Star Man"" quietly playing. It's quite haunting.If you're looking for a great film the whole family will enjoy, don't miss this one! But be sure to have some tissues handy. There are a couple of emotional scenes where even this jaded film reviewer puddled up a bit."
202,True Spirit,Fascinating Story.,8,"I get that the budget for this film was obviously not huge and you can clearly see that in the CGI and in some of the acting. But I feel that the story is so strong and interesting that it overrides all those factors and makes it a film worth watching.I was fascinated from beginning to end.Teagan Croft as Jessica Watson was no doubt the best performer in the whole film. She even out shone Anna Paquin who was very flat in this film. She felt very out of place and didn't seem to give it any ounce of energy.If you can focus on the story and put everything else aside, this is a very enjoyable film."
203,True Spirit,solid inspirational film,7,"Jessica Watson (Teagan Croft) is a 16 year old Australian girl planning to sail solo around the globe. Her mentor Ben Bryant (Cliff Curtis) has a troubled past. Her supportive parents (Josh Lawson, Anna Paquin) raised her on the waters. Her dad does have concerns while they face disbelieve and questioning from the outside world.This is a generally solid inspirational film. Teagan Croft is cute and energetic. Cliff Curtis is the solid veteran actor. Lawson is a character actor and it's funny that I probably know him best from Mortal Kombat. It's great to have Anna Paquin as the mom. She herself won the Oscar when she was twelve. It's all very nice and very safe. The safe part is a bit of a problem. I'm never concerned about her journey except for a small moment during the climatic storm. The movie needs to build more danger into the movie. It needs to start with Bryant's unfortunate sailing incident. It also needs to recount one or two sailors who died during their attempts. It needs to push the danger more. Instead, they leave it to the slimy news guy and the danger disippates. All in all, this is very inspirational and very standard."
204,True Spirit,A lovely journey,8,"True spirit was one of those movies that made me feel something. It was not just another movie that you forget and it was well made. The movie is about the real life journey of a sixteen year old called jessica watson. She grew up reading a book that inspired her and so she wanted to travel around the world solo. Jessica is played in this movie by teagan croft. She plays the role and emotions well. I loved the set for the boat and the way that the movie was filmed invites you to be part of the action. Helping her is ben, a friend from childhood thats a professional himself and played here by cliff curtis. The cast of this movie were all pretty good and overall it was just a really nice movie that was translated well to film."
205,True Spirit,"Nice story, good book, poor movie",5,"The adventure is amazing, the book is a 7/10 (read it last year) and the movie is very disappointing.As said, the main actress was more concerned with looking pretty and smiling, the music was awful, the soap opera vibe was everywhere, there was almost no real tension with all the situation...Some parts are not in the book, were created to romanticize some scenes.The best part of the movie is the ending with some real scenes of Jess arriving home.Overall, I feel that the adventure itself was not explored as it should be. The loneliness, the sailing, the danger, her routine...It was more like a teenager ""you can do what you want"" movie than an adventure movie."
206,True Spirit,Reality stretched to a disappointing degree,3,"As a sailor, I was excited for this movie but it disappointed me. I do not get why the writers decided to take away one of the major parts of the experience: Having almost no connection to other humans at all. In the movie Jessica uses her phone all the time- and has enough internet connectivity to even stream video in one of the most remote oceans of the world. In 2009 - where even today you wait minutes to get simple weather data.I laughed at the scene where she was taking her mainsail down with bare hands like it was nothing in a huge storm, which magically tightens itself up while she gets washed overboard. For sailors, this movie has a lot of these moments to be amused about."
207,True Spirit,Inspiring true story,10,"Fantastic film Something that inspires me to live a life that we thought we would but not many of them live it inspires me that not everyone will look at your dream as it is and maybe that is why we are here in the world to make a dent in the universe as Steve Jobs said we are here to show the world that there is something out there that is beyond the capabilities of a human mind but some of them are lucky enough to find a way to bring that sunshine home and show the world it can be achieved. It inspires us that if a 16-year-old can see a goal and go into the ocean alone while remaining optimistic, then we are fortunate enough to have a support system for ourselves while still on the ground in the mud."
208,True Spirit,Jessica makes you proud to be an Aussie,9,"This film, while somewhat lightweight and breezy, recounts the main things one needs to know about Jessica's incredible story.Well acted, and spliced beautifully with real footage, this is a tale that will make you feel both inspired and awe struck.As a fellow Aussie I followed her voyage with excitement at the time and remember vividly her return into Sydney harbourWatching this film with my 10yr old daughter, and seeing how inspired and amazed she was, reminds me of the hope and excitement for life Jessica inspired in us all back then.Watch this and know that this young lady (at the time) really was as incredible as the movie makes her out to be."
209,True Spirit,Inspirational adventure of sailing.,8,4 out of 5 stars.True Spirit is a good biographical film about a young teen sailor. Who sailed around the world in 2009. While the media and news were afraid of the risks. Her family being concerned and worried. The plot is inspirational as it follows her when she was young and motivated as she has everything planned out for her sailing trip. The acting is great. The film can be thrilling when she comes across some powerful storms in the ocean while her family are worried. The direction is stunning with its cinematography. It is one good film that will show a powerful message of inspiration.
210,True Spirit,Shocking Music,6,"The true story is remarkable, awe inspiring to think a 16 year old would want to sail solo around the globe let alone have enough about them to actually do it.Unfortunately the film goes down the sickly route. Ridiculous cringe worthy moments that really didn't need to be added. The story didn't need it, but the Director couldn't help themselves. At its worst it was like a soap opera episode and the music Director shouldn't be allowed anywhere near music, shocking is too polite a word for that.Also some of the extra characters were so cliche as to be almost rude. They literally put an African lady dancing when she was watching on video, only surprised the Scottish woman wasn't pissed.Anyway after all that the acting by the lead characters was fine and the story itself is so amazing it was still enjoyable. Just could have been so much better if handled with a bit more sophistication.I'm going to find the book and read that."
211,True Spirit,Must watch inspiration!!,10,Why dont people sometimes appreciate this kind of amazing movies... Its really unbelievable that it was real story but hoing through after jess's life it doesn't differ. The supporting family every person needs and was beautifully support from time and not giving u energy.every person who loves inspiration should go through this its not ony about the movie but character change like ben did. Would love to see more beautiful unfiltered bio pics like this. Jessica has myy support going to other direction of world or anything. After this big voyage i doubt if anything other than this bhig thing happened. Want to see more of her too.
212,True Spirit,A Perky but Limited Telling of a Historic Journey,7,"A biographical movie about Jessica Watson, who became the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the world alone in 2009. The film, which stars Teagan Croft and is directed by Sarah Spillane, details Watson's journey and the support she received from her family and manager.Despite criticism from the media and government officials, Watson persevered and completed her journey, overcoming multiple storms and windless stasis. The film showcases the beautiful sailing sequences and pays homage to Watson's determination, making her a symbol of the ""can-do spirit.""However, the film has its flaws. The screenplay tends to disrupt the dramatic momentum, and the perky, clean-scrubbed tone makes the film feel like a Disney Channel movie. The film also oversimplifies the story, focusing solely on vindicating Watson and her family and coach, while ignoring the messiness of real life.Overall, ""True Spirit"" is a suitable movie for younger audiences, but for those looking for a more nuanced and thorough account of Watson's journey, her memoir and the 2010 documentary ""210 Days"" are recommended."
213,True Spirit,"Predicable feel good, feels bad!",3,"I was really cheering for this movie to shake me or move me or both, especially knowing that it is based on a true story. But alas, I was deeply disappointed!The story followed a predictable path, naively and clumsily! The characters, especially the leading lady was unconvincing as she plodded through cliche lines and scenes, seemingly more concerned with looking pretty for the camera than staying true to what must have been a gritty character. Supposedly she forgot to bring her hairbrush and had to use a fork Yet, her hair looks hairdryer perfect, even after nights of super storms.I had also hoped that in our age of fancy CGI assisted effects, we would at least be treated to some impressive wet realism, but no such luck! The special effects of the storms, the boat, the waves and the starry night skies looked like bad B movie effects from the 50s!A wasted good story, told badly! Avoid!"
214,True Spirit,"A movie that will make you cry at some point, yet as uplifting as it gets",9,"Fantastic. A story written by real life can never be any better. The achievement depicted in this movie is almost unworldly.Also, the execution of the story is top-notch in basically every sense. The two leads are on top of their game putting in amazing performances, but that can be said for the rest of the cast. The production value is superb as so the camerawork, the editing, and the score, although I sorely missed the original song of 'Starman' from David Bowie when it really mattered. (Obviously, the song plays a small but vital part in the movie as the ship of her advisor name is Bowie. It is also a song her mother used to sing her when she was a child.) Apart from that, it is a beautiful, elevating movie that will linger in your mind for sometime to come.In one word: excellent.If you are down, watch this one. It may give you some energy to get back up."
215,True Spirit,Surprinsingly wonderful,9,"A tenacious Australian teen chases her dreams - and faces her fears - as she sets out to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world.I saw this movie on Top 10 Netflix movies and i decided to give it a try. But it didn't hook me immediatelyInitially i thought it was gonna be some cheesy feel good girl movie. And it was, but it was one of the best ones in recent yearsThe story needs some time to find it's footing but it's worth it. A bold, serious, gut wreching movie with great visuals and an emotion roller coaster. If you have older kids this is one of the best choices. Educational but also emotional and inspiring."
216,True Spirit,An inspirational true story,9,"As a budding sailor myself, I followed the real story with keen interest as it unfolded in 2009. And while I was twice Jessica's age, when she did her circumnavigation, Jessica's tenacity, determination and passion to follow her dreams, inspired me to do the same. To follow my own dreams.This movie adaptation of the real story IMO was executed beautifully. It was skilfully edited which kept the narrative flowing in a good pace. No unnecessary drawn-out dull moments. It kept me engaged the entire time. The CGI and filmography was equally good.But the best part was the directing and the actors. The director did a fine job steering the movie and leading the actors. The main actors, all did a tremendous job bringing their characters to life. I'm sure it's even harder when portraying real-world characters. There was not a single dud among them. But the true standouts were Teagan Croft (playing teen Jessica), and Alyla Browne (playing young Jessica). These two were brilliant.The only criticism that I have in the movie is the clothing Jessica was shown wearing during a violent storm off the coast of Tasmania. Not sure if that was truly what she was wearing in the real-world. But if it was, she should have been in her storm weather gear.VERDICT: A great true story adventure-drama captured wonderfully in this movie. A worthy watch for the entire family."
217,True Spirit,The movie we all need right now,10,"A true inspiring story brought to life, with the perfect cast. I couldn't fault the script or acting, I truely felt like I was on the journey sailing around the world. I have no intentions to follow the path of the main character, but never less, this movie will inspire you to go chase all those dreams you have been holding back on. Along with beautiful imagery depicting each challenge and triumph Jessica Watson faced. Make sure a tissue box is in reach and be ready to chase your dreams post viewing. This story will resolute with anyone and I could watch it again and again. Well done crew and we'll done Jessica!"
218,True Spirit,Must watch,10,"It is one of the best movies , I have ever watched. I cried so many times. The direction was so good , how the storms were depicted was amazing. Also the family , their feelings , the coach's feeling and also the difficulty of being isolated , all were so authentic. All the actors were amazing. It is one of the most inspirational movies, and must watch for students and athletes. The music was also very great. At the end ,the song with the credintials was so nice. Last but not the least, just at 16 years of age Jessica Watson did something which was tremendously courageous. She is an inspiration for everyone and is a real hero."
219,True Spirit,"Great story, poorly executed with cringy cgi",5,"Another cheap Netflix production rolled of the conveyor belt. Netflix in general has become a factory of quick produce without any consideration for quality. This story is worth telling, but the acting of most characters is terrible. Feels like you are watching a daily soap. The music in this movie does not add anything to the visuals. Another tragedy is the obvious green screen which you can clearly make out. For a film that is about sailing, the least you can do is try and make it look real by using actual footage on the water and sky. We see a couple of clearly cgi whales and dolphins that are equally cringy. This is for sure a movie you can skip. There's great movies out there about sailing that are worth your while. My suggestion would be to watch 'Adrift' or 'Kon Tiki' instead."
220,True Spirit,Inspiring and uplifting,9,"To be honest I watched this movie because of Teagan Croft but it was such a great movie! It was really inspiring to watch the story of the vovage but also to see how Jessica handled things like isolation and loneliness. I thought it was really cool how they filmed/showed the inside cabin of the boat (especially during the storms!) I think it has a great message to follow your dreams! I loved the music, loved the visuals and even got quite emotional at the end when we got to see real Jessica.There was a few little things they glossed over like a hand injury towards the end and the fact she forgot her hairbrush but had perfect hair the whole way through!!"
221,True Spirit,Rich with life lessons and inspiration for all,10,"I love the land and the people Down Under, so even if this movie was bad, I would've love it. But it wasn't bad. In fact, it was fantastic! Every little girl age 6 to 86 should watch this movie.The movie starts off with a great cast including Anna Paquin and Cliff Curtis and a great backdrop, Sydney Australia. The premise, an unconventional family and grumpy old sailor encourage and support the dream of their daughter/sister/student, Jessi, who wants to be the youngest person ever to circumnavigate the world unassisted.As you can imagine, Jessi's journey is not easy. Watch and see for yourself what she must overcome and how her true spirit inspires a nation."
222,True Spirit,Inspirational Stuff,7,"I tried to get my kids to watch this, hoping the inspirational story line would give them ideas beyond sitting and playing games on the iPad. But I failed so I watched this myself. It follows the true story of 16 year old Jessica Watson attempting to fulfil a (let's face it) very short, life long dream of being the youngest person to sail solo around the world.The film delivers, albeit in a bit of a lightweight way. The danger elements were few but done well. The sea does look scary at points, but I wanted a little more edge of the seat stuff. But this is aimed at the 10-16 crowd, so perfect in that respect.The film is almost 2 hours long, but it takes a long time for the world journey to actually start and the pacing of the film from that point is a bit too quick. Half way round The world in the blink of an eye. It is a true story and I can't believe it was all plain sailing (excuse the pun) for that half of the journey. It would have been nice to have a few more elements of danger and drama.It's always great to see Anna Paquin, but young Teagan Croft was excellent as the young protagonist sailor. I originally thought she was a bit too wide eyed and perfect teeth for the role, but at the end of the film you do see footage of the real Jessica Watson on the original boat and they are actually very similar in looks, so good casting in that respect.If you can get your kids to watch this, I would highly recommend!"
223,True Spirit,True Cringe,1,"The Auzies normally make straight down the line movies but this one comes straight out of the Hallmark channel. I hoped that once we had got passed the preamble, which is appalling, we might see some actual sailing but no, we're constantly interrupted by flash backs to the girls' earlier childhood with incessant reminders that she has to prove herself because she is a girl. It might also have helped to have given the girl some sailing training, she is lacking in basic skills like casting a line ashore, for example. In the sequence when she is departing Sydney harbour she is on a close reach, ie. Sailing as much directly into the wind as possible. It's a point of sail guaranteed to give entertaining sailing yet when she gets a small amount of spray in the mush she seems shocked. I tapped out shortly after. There's probably a great story here and the girl deserves it to be told better than this. If you want a great sailing movie I recommend All is Lost staring Robert Redford."
224,Plane,Exactly what I paid for,9,"Here was a movie that delivered exaxtly what I paid for. I went on a Friday night. Got a burger and a beer at the bar next to the theater, then got to watch a perfect Friday night movie. We need more of these types of films. Thrilling, edge of your seat action. Cool characters. Beautiful women. Dangerous bad guys. I think the important thing is not to over think it. Gerald Butler was perfect for the role. I could have seen Harrison Ford play this part well 30 years ago. Mike Colter was great as well. Looking forward to more with him. Overall, this one is definitely worth your time if you want a action 101 Friday night flick."
225,Plane,Surprisingly white-knuckle,7,"Yeah, it's constructed entirely out of familiar parts, without a single groundbreaking or original element. But Plane is able to fly above its generic ground by making the most of its actors and inherently tension-rich premise.Gerard Butler actually gives his best performance in years here. If this was just a paycheck for him, he certainly doesn't act like it.And director Jean-François Richet wisely paces the film in such a way that the characters have tangible time to breathe and take in what's happening between bursts of frantic action. He allows his actors time with lengthy shots to display the emotion their characters ought to feel.And because we see the characters feeling it, we feel it too. Even though the plot is largely predictable and formulaic, I felt the white-knuckle tension of the brutal action and the entire unhinged hostage situation because the visual focus of the director is always on the people in this story and the fear they feel.Richet uses almost exclusively handheld camerawork for this film, and I have mixed feelings on that. It does help with chaotic sequences to elevate the unease, but it also hinders the film when we should be seeing the outcome of fight sequences and it's sometimes obscured.Although I probably won't be watching it again and will likely forget about it soon, this is a surprisingly more-than-functional action flick that is certainly worth a watch for escapist entertainment."
226,Plane,"Yes it's flawed, but just what we needed...",6,"I figured out pretty early on that it didn't take itself seriously or at least Gerard Butler didn't.14 pax out of Singapore just before Christmas? The flight should have been full. There were lots of errors in predeparture and the comms with the tower when they taxi for take off. And no other planes? The set up was easy to see, prisoner being transported, bad storm and then we're off.This had all the hall marks of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and any other action film you can think of from the 80s. After all the dross coming out of Hollywood why not just bring a film out to do one thing and that's entertain. And that's what it did. No woke (and that's a word I hate) message, no easily identified alphabet people (because it didn't matter). Just an action film, a hero and the usual tropes to propel it along. Believability played no part as it didn't in Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando or Rambo (and any subsequent parts). Just a hero, a dubious helper (the prisoner, who's part was never explained but had skills) , a hapless bunch of passengers and some native evil doers with guns. Let the popcorn flow.I wish they had done more with the passengers, they turned out to be just there and will not be remembered. They certainly could have amped it up more and taken the 80s action higher but it was a good time waster and I felt no need to think beyond what was shown. Hence I didn't care about the errors.It's a 6 because it entertained me without preaching like most films do at the moment. But for God's sake, NO SEQUEL!"
227,Plane,Thank You For Flying Trailblazer Airlines,7,"This is a lean and yet solid 7 star shopping mall cinema action film starring the ultimate.throwback shopping mall cinema action hero, the modern day Gerard Butler. Not 300 Gerard Butler. The Gerard Butler now. Gerard Butler 2023, here equal parts Snake Plissken and Ben from Leaving Las Vegas. Unshaven, puffy and pale. I don't know if I want him flying my airplane but I still love him even after all these years, and I'm along for another ride. Heck, I even got frequent flyer miles.Here on Flight 119, Butler as Captain Brodie Torrance, does what he always does best. He makes you believe, and he kicks a little butt.Dare I say that his character participates in a one-on-one fight scene so intimate and visceral that it could hang with anything seen in a Raid film (major compliment!) or even, yes, the new Avatar sequel. It's true.There are other actors, longtime veteran character actors as part of the passenger list, or airline administration in this movie that are an absolute joy to see on the screen.Joey Slotnick (Twister) as a pain-in-the-neck passenger, you just know something is going to happen to him and it ain't good!Paul Ben-Victor (Body Parts) as a by-the-book airline executive, and Tony Goldwyn (Ghost) always bringing his best to every role. No different here.Two standout performances by co-star, Mike Colter as Louis, a prisoner on international transport on this relatively empty New Year's Eve commercial flight, and lastly, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous flight attendant, Bonnie played by Daniella Pineda. Wow.I will say this, there is no end scene but there most definitely should have been one with one of those characters for sure. I won't reveal who.The movie is a tight hour and forty-seven minutes which is most welcome in a world where it seems every movie regardless of genre or content easily runs well over two hours.Are there far superior plane crash/disaster films? Sure.Castaway comes to mind. Even Con-Air, which this seems to pull from just a bit.But this is a very good brainless movie. Just take your brain out before watching, eat your popcorn and enjoy.This is an entertaining and needed theatrical release. It may not be that original but at least It's not a comic book movie, or a sequel or prequel.Now return your tray tables to their full upright and locked positions and fasten your seatbelts.It's gonna be a bumpy (but fun!) ride!"
228,Plane,Good Popcorn Eating Movie,8,"I saw Plane, starring Gerard Butler-the Fallen movies, Tomorrow Never Dies; Mike Colter-Evil_tv, Luke Cage_tv; Evan Dane Taylor-Daredevil_tv, Blue Bloods_tv and Tony Goldwyn-Scandal_tv, The Mechanic_2011.This is a good popcorn eating action movie. It's not bogged down with any unneeded girlfriend in distress or other unnecessary plot fillers dragging it down. Just plane old action-and no snakes, either. Gerard plays the pilot of an airplane that is transporting a criminal-Mike-when the plane goes through some bad weather and looses all power. Gerard crash lands on the first place he can make it to but, unfortunately, it is an island controlled by unfriendly rebels. Evan plays the leader of the rebels that usually kill-or ransom and then kill-any foreigners that come across their path. Tony plays the head of the airline Gerard works for and he is trying to locate the plane so he can send in a rescue squad-want to bet on whether they make it in time or not?It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.I liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
229,Plane,OUTSTANDING ACTION MOVIE THAT WILL KEEP YOU TIED TO YOUR SEAT,9,PLANE is an almost perfect movie.Gerard Butler does is a different kind of action hero; more cerebral than violent while the younger guys do most of the violent parts.The bad guys; a bunch of (at least form me) unknow Asian guys are really terrifying.There no inserted romances or nice ladies in what is basically a male movie.The story itself is simple; a plane drops by accident in an island managed for some separatist rebels. The plane has no way to communicate its position and things become a survival game just for a short while.Not abusing spectators patience. The duration es perfect.There are couple of short tender scenes but delay the events for a few minutes; but that is nothing compared with the tension it generates the whole time.In brief; is an excellent emotional movie that deserves an audience.
230,Plane,Great 90s throwback,8,"The CG isn't convincing but that can't stop Plane from being a great 90s throwback that knows exactly how to execute all the expected genre tropes in fun and satisfying fashion and further proves that leading man Gerard Butler is the current king of B movies.Butler himself gives a terrific lead performance, charming and confident with the ability to humanise his leading man in a few scenes that linger on the shock and horror at the situation. Mike Colter is great with a deliberately closed off performance that makes him hard to read in a way that increases the tension.Together the two of them make for a likeable duo and don't overdo it with the rapport. Also worthy of mention is Tony Goldwyn whose character may be one note but he elevates the role so much and rescues his scenes out of their mundane nature.Jean-François Richet's direction is so good, the camera is constantly mobile and most importantly always comprehensible with a standout one take early on that kicks things off beautifully. The music by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp is so overly dramatic and that's exactly why it works.The pacing is basically perfect as well, at a tight 107 mins it doesn't even come close to over staying it's welcome, taking just the right amount of time to set everything up and build up to the crash and once they're on the island it just goes and does not let up."
231,Plane,Plane certainly isn't plain.,9,"So far, this is the best action thriller for 2023 and was surprisingly amazing. It certainly lived up to my expectations and even exceeded them. Sure, it could've had more Hollywood-styled adrenaline-pumping action, but I actually enjoyed French director Jean-Francois Richet's style of keeping it mostly tame, but also having the suspense and thrills constant throughout the entire 107 min runtime, with the added bonus of perfect pacing. Newb co-writers Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis gave us a great screenplay with excellent continuity and flow. All casting and performances were spot-on with Gerard Butler stealing the show. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me."
232,Plane,Action thriller that is flat but still has a good time.,6,"3 out of 5 stars.Plane is an action thriller that takes you on the edge of your seat thrills and has some action sequences that entertains. The films direction is flat and decent with everything else. The plot is okay. Its about a pilot after getting hit by a storm. Him and the passengers land in a hostile country. Which the passengers gets taken hostage. He and a prisoner who was also on the plane try to go on a search and rescue.The cast ensemble is decent. Gerard Butler is usually good with the performances. Mike Coulter is decent with his role. The film can be a little dull with the performances. The action sequences are nothing new but it does have some exciting moments.Overall, it is an okay film that passes the time."
233,Plane,"A 90s throwback, but I wish it was better",5,"Plane reminds me of the action movies of my youth. Most 90s action movies are pretty bad by today's standards, but I don't mind going back to the feel of those movies, modernized and updated to the latest action standards. Plane does this fairly successfully, yet still falters when it comes to making a good overall movie.The action itself is pretty good for the most part, although there isn't much of it. There's a pretty tense scene early on, a gritty fight scene I really enjoyed, and a mediocre finale sequence. Three action scenes isn't enough for a nearly 2 hour movie.Everything is surface level. There is no depth. It's filled with subplots but none of them are fleshed out even a little. And there is definitely some dumb stuff, like the worst customer service associate in movie history, or moronic side characters. There are a couple extra cheesy moments as well. I rolled my eyes multiple times.This review may seem very negative, but I did mostly enjoy this movie. It's more than serviceable. I just wish it was better, especially since I'm exactly the target demographic and am prone to liking dumb action movies. I hope we see more attempts at modernized 90s throwbacks, but done right. (1 viewing, 1/16/2023)"
234,Plane,Plane embraces the olde school 1990s action movie vibe. This movie rules.,7,"Plane comes from French director Jean Francois Richet (Assault on Precinct 13) and stars Gerard Butler and Mike Coulter. This movie just works, with no shaky cam and minimal but seething score behind it, Plane rumbles right through at a taught 1:47, and I just got a huge kick out of it.Though the trailer tells you exactly what the movie is and boy do they just run with it.The minimal cgi and VFX May baffle modern audiences but this works a throwback to the 1990s with clear and propelling action scenes with great camera work as well.Plane has a great action, a surprisingly full cast given the premise, and Jean Francois clearly knows what he's doing.See this in the theatre if you can. 7/10."
235,Plane,Search and Rescue,7,"Plane is a good action film filled with intense acting, gunshots, fights, and story. The story goes along with Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) flying his crew and passengers on an airplane with an dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) on board. When they fly into international waters that everything does not go according to plan. A violent storm strikes the plane causing them to land in a remote island somewhere in the Philippines filled with armed rebels. Brodie Torrance, Gaspare, and the military must rescue and escape with the crew and passengers before everything goes wrong. Overall, I liked it for what it is that a plane crash goes wrong and has to rescue everyone safely from the rebels. Also, Gerard Butler does not miss with his action films in this one. It is a good watch in theaters for a good action start in 2023."
236,Plane,disaster Rambo B-movie,5,"Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) is flying a budget airline plane from Singapore to Tokyo on New Year's Eve. The plane is old and there are only a few passengers. One of them is fugitive Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) being transported back to the United States. Lightning strikes during a storm and the plane goes down onto a lawless Philippines island.Realism goes out the window after the lightning strike. I have to say that it's a fun disaster movie for a little while. I expected the plane to land safely. I expected bad CGI. I didn't expected that even the little things are unrealistic silliness. For example, there is no way that Brodie would walk ahead of Louis when the two of them set off on their quest. It doesn't hurt the movie to do it the right way, but they insists on doing the wrong way. I also really hate the cartoon villains. They could be more interesting, but the casting director obviously pulled them out of villains R us. By the time of the Rambo action shootouts, I'm almost giddy from drinking the B-movie Kool-Aid. This is a B-movie and everybody is doing their B-movie best. I do wish for something better."
237,Plane,Good old fashioned enjoyable action thriller...,6,"Of course I opted to sit down and watch the 2023 action thriller ""Plane"", as I had the opportunity to do so, since Gerard Butler movies tend to be enjoyable.Writers Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis put together an entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And it was one that offered action-packed thrills right from the very beginning. Actually the movie kicks into high gear very early on and never slows down. And that, in my book, definitely makes for some good old fashioned action entertainment.The acting performances in the movie were good, and while it could certainly be said that this is an archetypical Gerard Butler movie, it still makes for some pretty good entertainment. I was genuinely entertained from beginning to end.Aside from Gerard Butler, then the movie also had good performances from the likes of Mike Colter, Tony Goldwyn, Yoson An and Paul Ben-Victor. So there were some familiar faces on the cast list.The action sequences in the movie were well-choreographed and executed on the screen, and that definitely added a lot of enjoyment to the movie.If you enjoy Gerard Butler movies then you will most certainly also enjoy ""Plane"".My rating of director Jean-François Richet's 2023 action thriller ""Plane"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
238,Plane,Well-paced action that is fun!,8,"Some movies are meant to have a simple fun time with. No need to try to be more than what they are. Inaccuracies can be ignored since this movie wears its identity on its sleeve. It's the inaccuracies and straight to the point filmmaking that tells the audience that you're in for a good time. Don't take it too seriously.The movie treads familiar territory, although it still feels fresh. The script does a fine job of staying mostly ahead of the viewer. You know generally what to expect, but the plot points that get us to the climax are handled well by not over explaining what's going on. The real life missing flight MH370 is an obvious inspiration for this film (it even name drops the missing plane in the movie). The plane itself is a driving force in the movie's narrative and supports the simple title of Plane. Our pilot hero is the most fresh part of the movie. He is set up as being physically capable of doing what he does, but is also more vulnerable than most action lead's.The pace is almost non-stop, action is easy to follow, and the movie surprisingly does have some heart in the end, which is helped by some fine acting. Expect to have a lot of fun with this, as long as you are willing to forgive the goofs and looseness of the plot. It's worth a theater watch or at least to watch with a group of friends!"
239,Plane,Full Throttle (and Some)...,4,"If you can ignore all the nonsense and absurd, close your eyes and make the world a little blurred, suspend belief (almost all), accept in full, do not hesitate to mull, take your reasoning, then make sure it's transferred. To be fair, there's not a lot of film left once you've done that.Gerard Butler doing what GB does best, in a story with plenty of mind numbingly repetitive and nonsensical violence, enveloped around a ridiculous scenario, with casualties and cadavers aplenty, which is fine, because you've seen it so many times before, and all that changes each time is the accent which, on this occasion, wasn't as Scottish as it could have been."
240,Plane,Tsk tsk tsk!,2,"This movie is totally braindead nonsens! Action without purpose, and over the hill scenes that just want to make you go back to the period of 1990-2010 when we really could make movies.Gerard Butler really stepped into it by participating in this one. Not only does he play a really bad Captain-role, but he also without any thought let the Captain act like Donald Duck driving a car.And it just get worse by the minutes.It is clear to all that making a movie today dont require any skills whatsoever. And finding a descent actor to participate dont seem to be a problem either.There is something wrong in the world of movies..."
241,Plane,"Closer to ""Plain""",5,"""Plane"" is such a lackluster movie with so many parts that seem...missing. You get the sense that there is a more flushed out movie here IF it was shuffled around differently. And that makes for a very frustrating viewing. The trailer pitch seemed to be a these two men on the poster who team to take on baddies. In reality, they spend a small window of time together, but more importantly don't have moments to breathe. A simple solution would be to clue us in on more of the criminal. Yes, much was given away in the trailer. He isn't a bad man. But what we discover as watching is...he isn't even a tough guy at all. Which makes it quite odd to watch him dispatch Filipino separtists (something they mention more times than you care to know). I think it was a mashing of a few cinema tropes. For instance, when the plane does go down, they cut away to the headquarters of Trailblazer Airlines which attempts to do damage control. This is taken from something like ""Under Siege"" or ""Air Force One"". If they were to steal from this, why not make Gerard Butler's character much more...deep. Instead, he isn't made to be very interesting. At some points I found myself asking ""What would Liam Neeson do here?"" Yeah, it falls under that category.So little time is spent on anyone. Or should I say quality time, that even the baddies don't seem that menacing. In fact, they seem sort of...blase about the entire occurrence. Silly as it seems, a local townsperson from a neighboring town actually alerts these jungle warriors into action. And we get a quick idea of their dirty deeds. Which seems so tiresome. This movie is really anemic to what could've made this a solid action flick. Like in when Rambo wrecked revenge on the Burmese militants. That was fun.Here, even Gerard's partner seemed so middling. He even seemed more the speed bump then the man attempting to make himself a good guy. Honestly, I half expected him to sacrifice himself to save the passengers and Gerard would say something clever. Nope. That would elevate this pic into something more fun.It seemed like they just made a very safe film. No heavy lifting. No real stakes. It just is.Now for those who want to see what happens pre-flight, they spend ample time at the beginning of this movie showing all that. To my impatience, I endured it with no reward.I will give them credit. WHEN the first deaths occur, the flight attendant Bonnie (Daniella Pineda) does not wig out. She remains stoic and steely. Something never shown in movies. A woman who doesn't go into hysterics. Chalk it up to trauma or training, I was surprised they chose this route. While refreshing, it would've also been nice to show all the pent up tension release. That would cause the tears to flow. Because she just saw people die. That's been getting on my nerves lately. The fact that this entire flight suffered horrific trauma gave no indication having survived a crash, and then fellow passengers murdered, that they all start cheering when all is well. Man, does that get on my nerves.People should be in shock. If anything, the placement of the merc soldier who says ""You're quite a pilot"" should happen as he steps off the plane and sits on the stairs. There is zero set up and absolutely no payoff.Incidentally, as far as movies that are shot digitally these days, this has to be one of the worst. Brendan Galvin is typically a solid cameraman. I surprised to see how video this looked. But again, I doubt he put up much of a fight when it came to getting this project done. He must've chose the less cumbersome path. And collected a simple payday. Which is something I extend to everyone involved.Yes, it feels like a straight to vid flick. Which, that said, isn't the worst of the ones in the bin."
242,Plane,A strictly below average showing!,4,"""Plane""; that's one of the laziest, blandest titles imaginable; I wonder if they were even serious when making the film!The final outcome suggests otherwise.It's one of the most contrived, chaotic (in a bad way) aviation/hostage thrillers I have ever seen. To say the writing is sub-par would just be an understatement.Everything happens all too easily. First, they smoothly crash landed, then the passengers were taken hostage & subsequently got freed with little to no effort. Shortly after the plane took off from the island and went to a nearby landing strip and saves the day (again all too easily) Leaving the audience with no scope to gauge the stakes.Although there were moments in the plot that were supposed to instil feelings of anxiety and dread, but nothing left a lasting impression due to its poor writing & a lazy, ineffective set-up. Even the actors (with paper thin scripts to work with) were incapable of salvaging anything of significance. Now the action isn't half bad, but when you have got nothing else backing it up, plans are bound to come crashing down (pun intended)."
243,Plane,Butler always gives his best,7,"Butler is part of a generations of action heroes, perhaps a bit long in the tooth now, who simply do not know how to give a weak performance. There is nothing new about the story, but the pacing is interesting. The director could have turned this into a race, a mistake too many actioners make, trying to constantly hype the audience with new thrills. Instead, the whole film is done more slowly, which in this cases makes the story feel that much more personal. A half hour into it, not a lot has happened but the audience starts to feel like they too are on that plane... and wish they were not. Overall a perfect film to keep you entertained for an overseas flight ... unless of course you have an overactive imagination. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
244,Plane,A movie with nothing new to offer.,3,"""Plane"" is the first film production to be released in theaters this 2023 and the result is not favorable. ""Plane"" does not offer anything new, a recycled script full of clichés and predictable scenes, it only becomes interesting during the first minutes in terms of the plane sequences that are reminiscent of disaster genre movies. The performances do their job without any additional merit, plus the director's work seems barely to exist. The cinematography is conventional without any appeal. The soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. The action scenes are bland and in some scenes the digital effects are quite unreal. A bad movie that fails to take off."
245,Plane,"Exactly what you expect, and that's a good thing.",8,"""Plane"" offers exactly what you think it's going to, not straying far-if at all-from familiar action movies like ""Under Siege"" or previous Butler characters like Mike Bannon. It's a well paced movie, roughly broken into 3 acts. But, for me, it's a surprisingly short movie. Just a little over an hour and half. I actually wished there were another 30 minutes to really flesh out the story and the characters, plus adding even more action. Gerard Butler is his usual solid, tough guy self and the addition of of Mike Colter (Luke Cage!) make the movie a really solid action duo. It's a light movie, but doesn't pretend to be something that its not. So, just sit back and enjoy the flight."
246,Plane,A Steven Seagal production?,5,"An FBI agent escorting a murderer who's an ex military, traveling on a plane. In the middle of the Pacific the plane is about to crash due severe weather and mechanical problems. In the worst part of the about-to-crash situation the FBI agent has his cellphone in a hand (Why?). Due the to bumps, the phone drops to the plane floor.A normal personal would hold, wait and keep safe, ignoring the phone, knowing you're not only responsible for your life but for others since you're ESCORTING A MURDERER.But in this movie, the FBI agents removes his seatbelt and goes, against everyone's advice, looking for his phone. A phone that won't do any good since YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC anyhow.What happens next is that the FBI agent is killed after a serious plane's bump. Also a steward is killed trying to sit the FBI agent down.The perfect scene for an audience that spends more time looking at their phones than real life around them. Without a question, that audience will find this scene very relatable.This scene defines the entire movie: All situations in this movie follow that same logic with the adding of drug cartels, a drunk hero pilot who badly needs to shave, annoying passengers who complaint because nobody rescues them in 30 minutes, a low cost airplane company hiring expensive mercenaries, and a long and sad etc.Movie could've been good, but they took it so many steps down so the young (and low IQ) audiences could follow the plot.Steven Seagal's movies are more realistic than this. Imagine that."
247,Plane,Plane..... Nonsense.,2,"First off we have Gerard Butler being the least believable pilot in movie history. We have the usual ""The pilot is late for his own flight"" cliché. The unbelievable fact of a prisoner suddenly being added to the flight with only one person to guard them. The plane losing all ability to fly due to a lightening strike. A crash in a jungle......
Honestly if you take the ten main plot points of the movie and read them out in random it doesn't even sound like the sort of movie that would get made.Nobodies acting is good. The script is terrible, the premise is a joke.It's hard to believe that movies have dropped in quality so much over the last couple of years.Dismissed."
248,Plane,credibile.. if you are 4yo,2,"Have you ever seen a 4 years old playing with a toy airplane? Well, pretty much that's an accurate description of the manoeuvres and the sounds the aiplane makes in the movie. Unsure how broke Jerard Buttler is lately but usually he wasn't accepting roles in such a low budget flick.Laughable storyline full of holes cliches and nonsense, meh acting lame villains and the worst special effects I've seen in years. Any big budget from the 1930s has probable better special effects. So, you've been warned, should you still want to see a terrible movie be my guest I know for sure I wish I get my time back."
249,Shotgun Wedding,Pure garbage,1,"I have this movie a good hour of my life, and I regret it. Here's why;
stupid settingdumb scriptbad casting (actors really don't mesh well, no chemistry whatsoever)bad actingnot funny at allaction is both stupid and childisheven when people die, you don't take it seriouslystupid music / sound effect to emphasize a certain scene (really annoying)did I mention it's not funny, like in; NEVER -sometimes I thought this was a parody, but I don't believe it to be, which is even worsereally bad effects, as in action looks fake (explosions look really fake, not to mention the stunts)"
250,Shotgun Wedding,Action rom com that is an explosive dud.,4,"2 out of 5 stars.Shotgun Wedding is a bad action romantic comedy film that has a dull plot, lacks the fun humor, and the script offers nothing surprising for its genre. Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Lopez are both great and fun likable actors. Sadly, the script offers nothing new or fun for there characters. The humor is very few in between scenes. Most of the humor it aims for is unfunny. The action is nothing new to the film. The plot is boring. About a couple about to get married on an island only to be crashed by pirates. And occasionally a predictable plot twist that is easily foreshadowed in the beginning. Overall, it is one dull action comedy film that is left alone on that island."
251,Shotgun Wedding,Why do movies like this still get made,1,"It's terrible, like a total waste of your time and a waste of the little talent that exists in the cast.You actually have to have nothing else to watch before even considering watching this. The plot is extremely silly, even for a comedy. Any laughs are extremely rare.Jennifer Lopez gets an opportunity to show how young she still looks and the rest of the cast look like they signed on for a decent pay day and a free vacation on a paradise island.The fact that films like this still get any investment is absolutely beyond belief.A far fetched comedy that will leave you thinking why did I bother pushing the play button on this movie."
252,Shotgun Wedding,"Yes, it is bad",2,"I am glad i didn't pay for this. First, somebody tell JLo she is bad actress or no actress at all. Somehow her acting skills get worse with time rather than the opposite.She is in her 50s, but in her mind she probably thinks she is still in her 20s, because her acting is beyond cringe. This cutsie behavior looks so ridiculous and unbelievable.And yes, the story itself is lame, and jokes are not funny, but her presence makes it even worse.The only saving grace is Jennifer Coolidge. She makes this movie somewhat tolerable and funny. Therefore, two stars from me.Bottom line, don't waste your money or time.Last thing, a personal plea to JLO: please, retire!!!!!"
253,Shotgun Wedding,Why's everyone so mad? Movie was hilarious,6,"I don't get why all these new movies get so many 1/10 reviews. Like really, a 1 for this? The worst you've ever seen? It's like people forget Caddyshack 2 exists.What kind of movie were people expecting from something titled, ""Shotgun Wedding,"" anyway?! It's supposed to be stupidly funny, which it is. J-Lo isn't even bad, so everyone needs to relax. Her and Josh are pretty damn funny together. Lighten up, people!Of course this wasn't the best comedy, but it was hilarious and entertaining... which I'm pretty sure was the goal! So if you just want to laugh and don't want anything serious, this is your flick!"
254,Shotgun Wedding,J Lo Rom Com,9,"It's a Jennifer Lopez Rom Com, and one of her better ones, so what were people expecting?It's got everything, laughs, adventure, suspense, a beautiful beach setting. Again, for a Rom Com, the script was fairly good. The good guys win in the end, so I hope that's not a spoiler.All-in-all I would have to say, it was much better than I expected, and kept my wife and I entertained the whole movie. It's not often that we watch the entire movie without one of us leaving the room to do something else, or we just decide to pause and watch it later. This was one that we laughed and shouted at the tv for the whole movie.Yes, I'd suggest it to anyone smart enough to understand it's a Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy. Have fun."
255,Shotgun Wedding,Can't believe reviews,2,Not only the silliest movie but the unbelievable part is that women rated it higher than men! If it was meant to be a romcom it wasn't funny and it wasn't romantic. If it was supposed to be an action film it failed that too. Jlo is easy on the eyes and in that respect it did pretty well.I gave it a 2 but that was because it had Cheech in the cast.Not only the silliest movie but the unbelievable part is that women rated it higher than men!

256,Shotgun Wedding,"Do better Hollywood. I tried, but it's truly awful.",1,"I'm usually wary of internet nerds bombing reviews with 1-3 ratings just for the sake of it and more often than not these movies are actually better than the negative would you have believe. Now I believe there's a reverse trend happening, where people just rate a movie a 8-10 just out of spite / to counter that trend. However, for this movie, you cannot convince me you actually this is worthy of a 8, let alone a 10. The reason I give it a 1 is because there's just a vibe of actings mailing it in for a movie they know was just never going to be good.Jennifer Lopez tries a bit at the beginning, but it's not enough as soon she also cannot help herself to get caught up in the sad reality that this is a cringeworthy bad movie. Script is bad, premise is a bit silly and there's no chemistry between any characters. It honestly feels like an Adam Sandler excretion that he will try to convince you was made with passion and one of his best ones yet. I can look past a bad script and even some bad acting if it's funny or the action is good, but has neither. I didn't laugh once during the first 40 minutes. I won't even bother describing the action. Do better Hollywood!"
257,Shotgun Wedding,Big messy fun,7,"It's no Oscar contender folks, and it didn't try to be. It's overall a mixed-bag full of some big laughs but also jokes that fall flat on their face.If you're into romantic comedies you'll find it humorous. I watched it with my boyfriend, mother and sister and we all laughed more than once and stayed entertained up until the end.Jennifer Lopez might as well be put on a stake at this point. Nothing but ""she's such a terrible actress"", ""she can't act out of a bag"", etc. Etc. To find here according to the negative comments. Calm down silly kids; people who can't act don't get continuously cast in leading roles for 30+ years. Sorry, that lame excuse is mute at this point.The chemistry is a bit to be desired between JLo and Josh Duhamel. The latter pulls off some tough scenes that other actors wouldn't have pulled off so smoothly without being so used to this material. I last enjoyed him in the other superior ""Life As We Know It"" off-playing Ms. Katherine Heigl and he does fine here. They have cute moments. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required.Cheech Marin and Jennifer Coolidge are almost in throw away roles, however Ms. Coolidge has had a sudden rise with ""Single All the Way"", ""The White Lotus"" and other very recent shows and movies under her belt. Good for her, and she's having nothing but fun here!! Some stand out scenes are hers alone...Lenny Kravitz is there. That can be a good or bad thing for some people. Like I said, overall a big, messy and fun mixed-bag. Simple plot, beautiful scenery, and a very quick and simple movie. If you like tropical island movies, rom-coms, weddings, pirates and ridiculous plot lines, this is for you.It's family oriented but not for the entire family per se.That's about the gist of it.Thumbs up!"
258,Shotgun Wedding,Why did I go to the cinema for this?,3,"Please do not watch this movie! It has everything a movie doesn't need:
1. Strange characters in the negative sense (especially the whole kinship)
2. Bad acting and even worse jokes (for example all scenes in the pool)
3. Unnecessary brutality that simply does not fit the film
4. A superfluous slow motion, which seems to exist only to save dialogues
5. And an absolutely predictable plot at all.So I don't quite understand why this film is being released in theaters. The most positive thing about the movie is that it's not super boring, but that's about it.... a good looking Jennifer Lopez is just not enough."
259,Shotgun Wedding,Most y'all need to watch it and pay attention,7,"The first few minutes are simply flat. There is no point until the pirates come in and take over.From there is many laugh out loud, ridiculous, rewind and watch again funny and action parts worth seeing a second time. I was worried when I started but had to pause and call people to watch it.As for the bad reviews are you people trying to watch a serious documentary and confused that goal with this movie? It is exactly a rom com action flick. Yes some parts were a bit weak but nothing was really bad about this movie.I enjoyed it. All the haters need to get a life. It's entertainment. I also happened to catch it for free. I would have paid for this if I would have known how funny it was. I would just cut most of the beginning right out."
260,Shotgun Wedding,It's Cute !!,7,"I have loved Josh Duhamel since he played ""Leo"" in All My Children. Obviously he's not winning any awards but he's charismatic as hell and very easy on the eyes.I don't understand the bad reviews, what were people expecting from this kind of movie ? I don't particularly like J-Lo but I do like her movies and this one is now my favorite of hers. I usually guess endings like this right away but I was surprised by the ""bad guy"" in this.Jennifer Coolidge plays the same role she does in everything else she's ever been in, no surprise there. Lenny Kravitz is so funny and sweet in this and he too is easy on the eyes.If you take Shotgun Wedding for what it is it's an entertaining movie you'll enjoy but if you're expecting award worthy performances you're in the wrong place."
261,Shotgun Wedding,"Bad directing, horrible music, terrible plot!",1,"The director and writer of this movie should retire, it's a super dull movie and I was so excited when it was over, what a torture! The movie is trying so hard to be action, thriller and funny all at once, but it's none, it's just so dull. The choice of music is just terrible, it made it even more difficult to like. Stop older women trying to be young & stop all that cheese needy love, Hallmark Channel trash. It's so hard to find movies nowadays that actually are written and directed well. Why do the majority of movies nowadays that are supposed to be funny/comedy have to use so much profanity? It's just not funny, but uncomfortable to watch with anybody, it's just too vulgar. I wouldn't watch it ever again and I wouldn't recommend you to watch it either. If you love cinema, don't ruin it with movies like this, stop it!!!"
262,Shotgun Wedding,"It's fun, it's short and has Jennifer Coolidge.",7,"This is no masterpiece of filmmaking but it is really fun to watch. It's okay that this movie isn't Oscar worthy. Some are just good romps.The writing is good even though some jokes fall flat. The cinematography and editing and directing are top notch. And I absolutely needed to see so many older actresses with great comic timing: Sonia Braga, Jennifer Coolidge, D'arcy Carden.There are plenty of great scenes and great pieces of dialogue and great performances so you can ignore the clunky, bad parts. This movie is definitely not a 10 but it's not a 5 either. 7 is my bottom rating for movies I think are watchable and fun. And this is one of those."
263,Shotgun Wedding,Yikes!!!!,2,"The only reason we watched this was because we saw that Jennifer Coolidge was in it. Unfortunately, not even JC could save this mess. There were maybe 3 slightly laugh out loud moments, and of course, they all pertained to some line Coolidge said. The rest of the movie was just plan stupid. Jennifer Lopez is a terrible actress and I am not sure why she is playing a bride.....again! She is very type cast, but at 50 now, she needs to just stop. The acting overall from everyone was atrocious. The movie lines were atrocious. The special effects were atrocious. I am not sure how many more times I can say the word atrocious to meet the word limit here!! Pass this movie up. It's pretty dumb."
264,Shotgun Wedding,A fun action comedy if you can get past the first 20 minutes.,6,"Starts off a little meh. It has a generic rom com feel (but with a great cast). But if you can make it past those first 20 minutes, it turns into a fun action comedy.The Bride and Groom have to take out a band of pirates. And it's an amusing premise. A couple of standout moments were the kitchen & helicopter scenes. There is also a few good 'set up and pay off' scenarios that happened throughout the movie.There was even a couple of interesting twists. I didn't see the first one coming, but I thought the 2nd one would be cool if it happened - and then it did haha... But it was still good to see it play out.Overall, a satisfying watch. I'd give it a 6.5/10."
265,Shotgun Wedding,Infantile.,5,"The entire story was cheesy and infantile. A fifth-grade drama class could come up with a better, funnier and more realistic story. Some of the dialogue was cringeworthy, and all attempts at humor were misses. The all-star cast did try their best with what they had to work with, but to me, the only fun this film had to offer was the evident fun all the cast had making this film, and not the viewers. It's as if all the cast were invited on vacation and just hung out together having a great time with very little concern for making a decent film. Add the usual ""look at how great I am and look"" J-Lo scenes constantly flaunting her mid-life crisis, and there's your film. I can't even recommend this as a decent one-time watch, because it's nothing that hasn't been done before, many times, and done much better."
266,Shotgun Wedding,A 50 year old woman trying to act 20,2,"2 points for the scenery. I haven't seen Jennifer Lopez in anything for ages and I would now actively avoid watching something if I saw she was in it. She is irritating in this film trying too hard to be dizzy and cute and not achieving anything but annoying. She looks the same age as her mother in law to be. The storyline gets just stupid, not funny, stupid. The main two characters have no chemistry but that's down to Lopez and how she is overacting constantly. Having her breasts pushing out into the viewers face does not constitute a good film unless you're really that into her as a sex object. Time she just stuck to being married to Ben and gave up these useless waste of time films."
267,Shotgun Wedding,Goodbye Logic!,8,"Going into this movie I didn't have the slightest idea what it was about. But, I love both Josh and J-Lo, despite her many flops in past movies. I can ONLY recall her in the movie Enough because it was SO good! All of her other movies just slip my mind and I'm certain I have seen all of her movies. That being said, this movie was far-fetched and completely for entertainment only. The comedy in it was just ok, but the action was on point. It reminded me a bit of Sandra Bullocks movie with Tatum. Now that was a movie I loved! It was so funny, much funnier than this one. So although this was not one of my favorite movies it was also not one I hated. I almost expected the cops to show up at the end when they were lying down in the boat. So, if you like action movies that are crazy and far-fetched then this is a movie for you! I wouldn't mind watching it again. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to pass some time."
268,Shotgun Wedding,Explosive stuff,7,"No pun intended - J Lo ... you may wonder what roles she may be playing in a decade or so ... but you may just not ... and just enjoy the movie right here. It is light fun - with a lot of cursing and quite a bit of action too. This is not close to the Sandra Bullock/Channing Tatum movie - but it still is fun! Just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow - even if the flow is all over the place.There are some interesting jokes (some are hits others are misses), there are some adult flavored jokes (though there could have been at least one more, sneaky one within the pool or maybe it's just me) and there are some ... well lame jokes too.The movie is kind of all over the place. But what a beautiful place to be all over ... well no pun intended. Great cinematography, because of the great location. The sense of urgency and the sense of danger is looming ... the fine line is being walked on ... but you really have to overlook quite a few ... well let's call them flaws. But if you are into it and into the cast (some great people in it) and not annoyed by them, you'll buy anything ... and have a blast with the song/performance during the end credits too."
269,Shotgun Wedding,Not bad weekend watch,7,"JLo is in her girl-next-door average folk persona but remains the sexiest +50 year old n media. A mild comedy at best with some extreme slapstick violence, this is 2023 now right? Duhamel is OK, is kind a bland grey-temple guy. The entire movie seems to have been filmed at a single resort type location. In this case it's the DR masquerading as the Philippines. JLo shows off some skin as the action turns to foiling the bad guys. Standard second bananas fill out a wedding party cast, colourful personalties getting a few one liners and sight gags. It's a decent but nothing overly new or surprising."
270,Shotgun Wedding,Great comedy action flick,9,"I really enjoyed this more than I thought I was going to. When I saw the trailer to Shotgun wedding I knew straight away that I wanted to watch it. I love Jennifer Cooligde and I love Jlo as an actress, so I was willing to give it a go. It really exceeded my expectations!It had me smiling all the way through the movie, and it is definitely a film I will watch again when I want to have a laugh.Jennifer Lopez can hold her own on the screen. Josh Duhamel and Jennifer definitely had the chemistry going in this film.Basically the film is about a couple (Jennifer and Josh's characters) who are tying the knot on a beautiful island in Asia, paid for by themselves, because he doesn't want her stinking rich father to pay for it.The resort, though beautiful is cheap.. maybe because it is prone to pirate attacks. Something he fails to tell his perspective wife. There is a lot more to it, but I won't add spoilers, sit back and enjoy the ride yourself, you won't be disappointed.Yes, a lot is far fetched. But you don't watch this kind of film for realism, it is to escape and have a laugh."
271,Shotgun Wedding,So what really mattered to me was...,6,"Mid way through the first act Lopez' character says ""I'm a grown woman"" and for that I will give this film full carte blanche and I'll tell you why - for years now it seems that the term 'grown woman' (or man or idk marsupial) requires the addition of the word 'ass' interjected inbetween - as in ' look here chum, I'm a grown ass woman and I do what I want' robble robble (sorry I think I temporarily turned Into the Hamburgler, and for certain a curmudgeon) because it's just so frustrating and annoying to continue to listen to people say things and use terms that they don't even understand why they're saying them - anyway - LISTEN, IT'S ENTERTAINING - DISREGARD THE 1 STARS."
272,Shotgun Wedding,Not as bad I predicted,7,"This movie was one that I thought would be another example of my wife laughing her ass off and me wondering why I had committed two hours of my life to a garbage heap. But, I actually watched it by myself and wasn't disappointed. It actually made me laugh at the right points and I'm not gonna lie that seeing JLo in a thing and and ever disappearing wedding dress didn't help make this movie more enjoyable. I thought the cast was great. I love seeing Lenny Kravitz. Cheech Marin was a nice addition and for once Jennifer Coolidge made me laugh without making me cringe. So give it a try and realize that it's not an Oscar winner, but a fun adventure."
273,Shotgun Wedding,Dont waste your time,1,"What some so-called actors like Mrs. Affleck, will do for a paycheck and their over fed ego. The producers, director and actors of this overtly contrived piece of RomCon, would in a normal world, be completely embarrassed by such a shamelessly predictable plot and overly phony characterizations. About the only half-way decent thing in viewing this dismal failure is the scenery, shot in the Dominican Republic. If one is really intent on throwing away an hour and forty minutes of their life on this bad piece of cinema, one would be doing themselves a favor by muting the sound and reading the closed caption. There is little comedic value in Shotgun Wedding. It should have been shot and put out of it's misery on the cutting room floor."
274,Your Place or Mine,Can we have more Witherspoon but in a better film? [+40%],4,"This one stays watchable thanks to a bright, buoyant-as-always Reese Witherspoon, but the writing and direction are on auto-pilot. For a film that pretentiously begins in 2003 and ends in 2023, there's very little actual romance or comedy here that grabs your sustained attention. The film just plods along in a familiar ""can best friends turn lovers?"" setup, the payoff of which is so minuscule and very 2003-like. Sure, it's not a film you'd ditch half-way, yet it has nothing that warrants a revisit - as is the case with most Netflix ""originals."" Also, a film like this would have actually benefited from having Kutcher and Witherspoon in the same space (to hell with those split-screens) a lot longer than 5 minutes tops. Hands up if you think Witherspoon deserves a better-written, better-directed comeback film! 🙌"
275,Your Place or Mine,Leave a lot to be desire,6,"I kinda tune out in the middle. The potential is there since we have been running out dry from rom-com movies with big stars.Also coincidently this movie comes out as I was in the mood for Legally Blonde and thus I'm in the mood for Reese Witherspoon.She looks fabulous here and Ashton also looks good to look at.Unfortunately, they don't have much interaction at all and the whole movie is just not that interesting. Not much comedy, not much chemistry between the main character due to their distance. Sleepless in Seattle developed more connection despite the long distance and communication through radio.Definitely a miss opportunity...I do like Zoe Chao's character. She's like the best friend to have. Supportive, rich, and fun to be around. A scene stealer."
276,Your Place or Mine,"Sadly, not good",2,"First off, I really, really like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" which I've watched repeatedly. This is the same writer.""Your Place"" to me is just facile and lazy writing. During the first hour, I kept debating whether to stick with it. Since there was nothing else on, and I was tired from the workweek, I did. When Jesse Williams (from Grey's Anatomy) showed up, I perked up because, well, it's Jesse Williams! The movie did start to move a little faster then. Faster but not better.There's no real tension in the movie until the last scene, which feels tacked on just so there can be a climactic ""I hate you, no - I love you!"" scene. Everyone gets what they want effortlessly. Want a top NYC editor to read your friend's book? Both he and his assistant read it overnight and of course, want to publish it. Debbie/Reese is taking a graduate class but never has to study. Want your friend's kid to be on the hockey team? Even though his mom hasn't let him play hockey, he makes it on the first try.It's a lot of telling, not showing. We're told they've had this 20 year best friendship, but we don't see anything that would lead us to think that. We're told they fell in love the first night, but we don't see it.I think because I already have good will towards Reese and Ashton, I automatically root for them from the top to the extent that I care, which isn't much.Zoe Chao is the one really funny character, but that may be more the actor than the writing. I was happy to see Steve Zahn but then his character was just dumb. The young actor playing Jack was very good. I didn't like it, though, when Jack was given preternatural insight for his age.There's no actual comedy, except for Zoe Chao. Maybe if the writer had rewritten it a bunch of times and made the dialogue better. I can't remember one line standing out or making me laugh.I know the writer can do much better, given she also wrote ""Devil Wears Prada."""
277,Your Place or Mine,Pleasant but Forgettable Rom-Com with Capable Cast,6,"A standard romantic comedy that takes place in 2003. Directed by writer Aline Brosh McKenna, who has written many popular romantic comedies, including ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" the film is a typical feel-good movie that is good for a lazy day on Netflix. Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher star as Debbie and Peter, who have been best friends for 20 years. They are opposites, with different lifestyles and personalities, and the movie follows their journey as they switch homes for a week. While the two lead actors are good-looking and charismatic, the film is let down by its bland script and lack of depth. The supporting characters, including Tig Notaro and Zoe Chao, are more interesting, but overall the movie is predictable and lacks any real twists or surprises."
278,Your Place or Mine,"They're too old for an ""I don't wanna ruin our friendship movie""",3,"To be honest the ""I don't want to ruin our friendship"" premise for romcoms is pretty common. However by the time you're in your 40s and you're still saying this it's kind of pathetic. Movies like this work better for characters in their 20s that have been friends since they were kids. The movie was generic, boring and predictable. Tig Notaro plays an interesting side character they both apparently have known for years but with no backstory as to how. Steve Zahn plays a silly gardener they attempt to utilize as comedy but really just comes off as a pointless character and quite frankly a waste of Steve's time. She briefly has an affair with a dude she has no chemistry with and like no other rom-com before (great sarcasm here) they kiss and make up at baggage claim in an airport after confessing their love for one another only a whopping 20 years later. Film seemed like a cash grab for both of them."
279,Your Place or Mine,Title makes no sense,1,"Which executive approved this project at Netfix? Worst script ever. Horrible director. Waste of money. How do these amateurs get away with it? Too many Netfix productions are horrible, but this one takes the cake. It's like when someone is making a movie for Netfix they don't take it seriously. They are paid up front and don't have to worrie about box-office figures, because of course everyone is gonna stream it... And if they don't, well, then who cares? Because we don't need to get out of bed and drive down to a cinema to watch it. I am sorry, but since streaming became King the movies became crap. There, I said it!"
280,Your Place or Mine,I missed this kind of rom-com,8,"You can say it's cheesy, unoriginal, or old-fashioned, but it works for me. As a millennial, I was so excited to see Witherspoon and Kutcher, icons of rom-coms in early 2000s, come back as grown up couple, so I admit I can be biased. Plus, best friends-to-lovers trope always works on me. It is refreshing to see romance movie that two main characters do not spend much time together physically, but audience can sense their friendship has been strong partly because they have been friends to us millennial for a long time as well. Alicia who has watched their twenty years as a friend is one of us. Chemistry is still there just with phone calls or conversations even without physical interaction. I just missed rom-com with early 2000s vibe."
281,Your Place or Mine,What happened?!,5,"I really wanted to like this movie as I am a fan of Reese Witherspoon and love her work. Normally. However watching it I asked myself what happened to her acting (mediocre and so not up to par with her other work), whatever happened to Ashton Kutcher's face, and whatever happened to their chemistry (virtually nonexistent). It's fine as light entertainment for an evening in when you're sick, but unfortunately not what I expected. I'm puzzled.The story is kind of foreseeable, the characters a little shallow. The best performance is by Steve Kirsch (in a minor role) who was the only one getting a giggle out of me.I like Witherspoons work so much that I almost feel guilty for being disappointed, but there you go..."
282,Your Place or Mine,Hmmmm,5,"I really wanted to love this. Really really, I love romcoms, it had a great cast, promising if cliched story, I still had high hope. Sadly I didnt love it, I barely liked it. And i have questions .............. if they are the best friends ever how have they never visited each others homes ? And also when Debbie can't get in touch with peter who is responsible for her son, being the helicopter Mum she is why is she not freaking out . Also it was waaaaay out of the blue the sudden romantic feelings for each other. It kinda came out of left field. I feel sad , I'd been waiting to watch this for weeks and then boom, the night of release arrived . I just felt let down 🙁"
283,Your Place or Mine,Stinker,1,"Netflix does it again, yet another comedy rom/com stinker. Seen so many of these types of films on netflix where straight away you see actors doing it for the money. Don't get me wrong occasionally Netflix gets it right and produces a good film but never in the comedy feel good rom/com type genre. This is another Netflix film that thinks this is what people want too see, and once again they get it completly wrong. No chemistry between the unbelievable characters who speak unbelievable dialogue in unbelievable situations. Who ever makes the decisions about what films too make at Netflix needs showing the door because time after time they get it spectacularly wrong."
284,Your Place or Mine,Amazingly dull,6,"This film has great actors. The storyline offers plenty of opportunities. The acting isn't even bad. My 6 has been rounded upwards. The average is already below 6 while writing this review. This film is so dull and almost boring. Even the trailer is more funny than the entire film. Is it a comedy? Not really. Is it drama? Not really. Is it a romance movie? Perhaps for a few minutes. Is it dull? Yes and unfortunately. But why??? Is it related to Netflix quality control ? More and more, I'm inclined to think so. What a shame. Soon the updated Netflix access controls will kick me out. It feels almost a blessing in disguise."
285,Your Place or Mine,Who presses the green light to make this rubbish,2,"Let's start with the story as this is simple. The story makes no sense what so ever. It's empty, soulless & compassionless. Having a millionaire tech guru doing the garden of our heroine for free whilst he employs a gardener to do his own Garden. What is all that about?The main protagonists Reese Witherspoon is an aging actress starring in a film that should have been for a 20 year old something & not a 40 something. Ashton Kutcher is an appalling actor & between the pair of them there is zero chemistry zilch nada nothing. TBH there is zero chemistry between any of the actors. It's just a bunch of people saying stuff in different scenes which leaves me as the watcher not caring what happens to anyone. They even screwed up making the kid appealing.All I can say is that Netflix needs to be challenged by other film makers to stop this utter garbage from being made."
286,Your Place or Mine,Awful film,3,"Story line is awful and its so slow and boring I fell asleep on the first attempt to watch. On the second watch I couldn't finish the film.Actors did their best with what they had but I really can't recommend watching this. It attempted to make you guess the storyline with some very weak relationship build ups, but all it did was let me down.It has a cheap low budget feel to it and I really do think Netflix were relying on the big budget actors to make this film.It's a shame because with the line up it should have been a really good evening film for couples, but I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me."
287,Your Place or Mine,Justice for Minka!,6,"This movie was good and cute. Nothing great by far; but for a directorial debut the motions are gone through and it works. Like other comments mention there is a lot left to be desired.Strong points: The soundtrack? Phenomenal. I see little to no one mentioning it and it's worth mentioning. Lots of classics, cool mellow tunes that go with the movie's flow and I couldn't help notice every time one came on I felt a great sense of like they knew what they were doing. (My dad loved The Cars.)Reese Witherspoon is of course a treat to be delighted in. She claims her scenes with ease. Zoe Chao as Minka was the comedic relief the movie needed to break it's ice for me, however. She is HILARIOUS. I love the character, love the actress and her portrayal. It's all too much. ""I smell dead people..."" *dies laughing* Every time she came on screen I smiled.The downsides: The movie has a very meandering pace. There's a lot of content with not really much to say. Nothing big really goes on. Like I said it all just going through the motions even if it does it well. It's all a character development and how they play off each other. Steve Zahn and Ashton Kutcher don't bring as much as they could but I guess their characters are slightly less under written.If Minka starred in her own movie I would definitely watch it. That's how much I loved her.Anyway, a very soft thumbs up. 6/10 stars. I don't think I'll revisit again if only for the comedy of Zoë Chao and her use of the character Minka, but ""like my drunk mother used to say, mind your own business..."""
288,Your Place or Mine,"If You Like Average, You'll Love This",5,"The most average rom-com possible. Hallmark films have more life and originality. I found myself longing for a guy in flannel to sweep the lead of her feet. While those films have the same basic storyline at least they're entertaining.Vanilla ice cream is my favorite. Vanilla movies are not. Who doesn't like Reese Whitherspoon and Ashton Kutcher. But not in this dull, flat, lifeless film.Steve Zahn and Tig Notaro were wasted and those roles could've been played by no name up and coming actors to at least give someone new a shot.Perfectly generic. At least it had a good budget so the production value was nice. Good job with the LED volume scenes in New York."
289,Your Place or Mine,I really enjoyed this,6,"OK let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, there is zero chemistry between Kutcher and Witherspoon. But there isn't supposed to be. They are both unaware of each others' feelings. So there's bound not to be chemistry.It's predictable? Well yes, but only in as much you realise after a while they will end up together. But it is rarely the destination that matters, it's the journey that counts.Was it La La happy? Yes, it was very positive and upbeat and we all need a bit of that. But that's not a bad thing, a great romcom should be positive and upbeat.I think Witherspoon was fantastic and Kutchner was OK, and the film was fine and entertaining and light hearted and positive and happy ending. For me that's a success."
290,Your Place or Mine,"Flawed, but watchable",7,"The main flaw is the lack of chemistry been the two main characters, as others have said. This is undeniably true. It's hard to see why they would be friends at all, let alone prospective lovers. But even so, the film is perfectly watchable - and I've sat through many far ""better"" films which I've enjoyed less.The individual performances (I could happily watch Reece Witherspoon reading a telephone directory) are perfectly fine, and in a sense the movie is carried by its co-stars: Zoë Chao, Tig Notaro, Steve Zahn, Griffin Matthews. And there's a lot of fun to be had. The film also portrays very clean, orderly, almost antiseptic New York and Los Angeles which border on surreal.This film is like an after dinner coffee and chocolate; a relaxing, comfortable morsel but hardly main course stuff. I have no problems with easy watchable films, with a bit of humour thrown in. A ""great film"" it ain't; a pleasant way of whiling away an hour and a half it very much is."
291,Your Place or Mine,Watchable but not what I expected,5,"I was eagerly awaiting this movie as I like both Reese and Ashton but it was quite a let-down. It was so boring, I fell asleep half-way through. As everybody before me has said, no chemistry no emotion which is the foundation of a rom-com. But tell me this, they are never together in any scene until the very last scene. Throughout the entire movie they only interact through phone across the country, so how does one display chemistry. It is the script that made the movie so boring. It could have been another Harry met Sally where long time friends discover the love after 20 years, but not here. And yes, Ashton does 'look' older, no more Michael Kelso sadly."
292,Your Place or Mine,No Chemistry,5,"The film was a delightful and charming movie that left a smile on my face. The humor was well-timed and the story was cute and engaging. Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon both delivered strong performances, bringing their unique comedic styles to the film. However, despite their undeniable talent, there was no real spark or chemistry between the two lead actors. This lack of chemistry was a bit of a letdown as it detracted from the overall romantic atmosphere of the film. Nevertheless, it was still a fun and entertaining watch, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and heartwarming scenes. The supporting cast was also fantastic, adding depth and dimension to the story. Overall, the film was a fun and light-hearted movie that would make for a great date night or family movie. While it may not be the most memorable film, it's definitely worth watching for its light-hearted and charming atmosphere."
293,Your Place or Mine,Bad chemistry that fails as a rom com.,4,"2 out of 5 stars.Your Place or Mine is a bad romantic comedy film that not only is predictable with its plot but falls flat with the two main characters Reece Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher. There performances are flat with there characters. The chemistry is tedious. About two best friends switched places for a week. The story is forgettable. The acting is stale. It is a difficult romantic film to even care for the characters. I did find the film to be forgettable and boring. The script also was also lacking the development in putting any depths with the characters. Overall, it is one rom com that is worth skipping."
294,Your Place or Mine,"Well, It Is What It Is.",4,"This is clearly Reese Witherspoon film. Strangely, it has Midwestern touches, less LA or NY as the mentioned cities.First of all, this is Ashton's walk in park. Just smile and be an eye candy of a man. Despite showing acting versatility, Ashton seemed out of place and taking it too easy. Practically, any actor coukd play his character.Reese was at home, playing neurotic and overprotective mother. It's not an acting challenge at all for her.Zoé Chao stole the attention with her sparkly character and city gal charm. Although, her character was written way too well-like at the end.The chemistry was way off. Yes, they looked like 2 best friends. But both didn't show the eye language of 2 people in love with each other, good friend but no love. Maybe because of the director or maybe the script wasn't inspiring enough.The storyline woyld make a good straight to cable film, but not a theatrical release. It's a good Hallmark's style romantic film, that's about it."
295,Your Place or Mine,Nope. Save your time,3,"Contains spoliersSo, the movie starts off very slow and boring and then is super rushed at the end. Both the main characters careers aren't explained it's not really a love story but is at the same time. Ashton doesn't realize that he's fallen in love with Reese until the last 30 minutes and at the end of the movie he's like ""I've been in love with you forever"" they aren't compatible and there isn't any chemistry. There are multiple jokes in the movie that don't really land. I think they were trying to make this a non predictable movie but we all know that they are going to fall in love at the end."
296,Your Place or Mine,"good cast, but....????",4,"Actually looked forward to this film, the storyline sounded great.Reece Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher exchange apartments in New york and L A.Witherspoon is doing a course, while Kutcher looks after her 14 yr old son in L A. Debbie gets to learn all the things about Peter whilst staying in NYC, which gives her an idea how he has been living the past years, with his relationships etc, whilst Peter contends with all the issues looking after Jack, Debbie's son.After they had been in some sort of relationship 20 years ago, and have only been in touch only over the phone, I felt the film lost all navigation, someone you had not seen for all this time would come to L A, and look after your son ( who incidentally has all the allergies and requirements that required passing a housekeeping exam) , Debbie an extremely controlling mother, seemed it ok to leave him with Peter, someone she considered a childless womanizer, which was backed up by the arrival of Minka played by Zoe Chao.I guess there was some decent comedy which is why I gave it 4 stars and a very good cast to boot, but the whole swapping agenda story along with some of the sub-plots were terrible."
297,Your Place or Mine,Awful ! Zero Chemistry! My stars are only for Jack and Mika !,3,"What a waste of good actors ... the movie is so boring and coming from someone that watches even Hallmark movies !Reese and Ashton have 0 chemistry !Whoever directed this movie should think about a new career choice.My stars are just for the kid Jack and the friend Mika , they were the ones that made this 2 hours of boredom watchable ...
And that end was sooo cheesy I can't even recommend this move to someone is going to watch while ironing !!There was such a hype about this movie when it was advertised that one could never imagined from the propaganda that this movie was this dull!Do better Netflix!"
298,Your Place or Mine,Stars do not make a good movie,4,"I love most of the actors that are in this film. My husband and I enjoy romcoms. We literally look for new ones to watch. But this is the second new streamer-produced romcom we've seen lately that flops. Honestly, Prime's Shotgun Wedding is worse. We couldn't even finish that one.No wonder the streamers are losing money. It's not just about the stars. It's not about the premise. It's about the writing and directing. In the case of Your Place or Mine, I agree with other reviewers that this is a poor use of Reese Witherspoon's talents. It's true of the other actors, as well.Netflix and others need to look past the premise and the stars and READ the script before green-lighting. If they had, perhaps they'd have noted that it's disjointed, not particularly funny, and that the characters themselves aren't at all real. There is no depth or logic to any of the characters. It doesn't have to be a lot for a romcom!The leads are both supposed to be inherently creative types. She is supposed to be a repressed editor.Ashton Kutcher is supposed to be a clandestine writer and avid reader. Yet, his apartment is barren. Even his books are on the shelf by color, presumably decorated by a professional designer. He is revealed to be a marketing consultant who can't commit to a company nor to a woman. Marketing is often a creative career, and I don't know a single marketing person who would have an apartment like what they portray for him. That apartment would suit a techie, perhaps, or, indeed, a math whiz. The Porsche works, and his sense of humor work. The fact that he reads a lot works. But that's it. His character isn't complete. Kutcher does the best he can with this, but it just doesn't connect.Reese's character is supposed to be like an old hippie. Long skirts, jean jackets, bohemian. Her house fits that. However, the screenwriter has her in a completely nonsensical career in math. Math? She reads voraciously. She was probably an English major in college. We don't really know if she's ever edited, but it's what she wants to do, just doesn't think it's practical. Why did the writer put her in some kind of math class? And for what job? That's never revealed that I saw. Why wasn't SHE in marketing for a career? Sales, even? Those and others would make more sense than some indistinct job in math for everything else about her character. Plus all of her week-long shenanigans in LA wouldn't have given her time to study to actually pass a test. Is she naturally a math wiz? I didn't see the evidence in her personality as written.No, romcoms aren't typically in-depth. But the good ones do better than this. The best in class is When Harry Met Sally. It not only had good acting, but an excellent script for them to work with.And, in good romcoms, there is chemistry. I didn't see that among any of the characters. It was as if they were all independently floating through the movie, especially Steve Zahn's character of the neighbor. What exactly was the point of his character? The only character with any depth was the kid, Wesley Kimmel, and his scenes were fun. This was also a poor use of Tig Notaro. She's naturally funny, and some of her lines worked. But again, no depth, no engagement.Netflix, stop scrimping on writing. If a new writer needs a chance, at least get someone with more experience to help them hone good, worthy scripts. Please!"
299,Viking Wolf,Laughable,4,"This is one big pot of nonsense stew. The script doesn't have a single original idea, everything is borrowed, both from superior movies and equally stupid ones. It's like an amateurish mashup of every werewolf movie you've ever seen. Ginger Snaps in particular says hello throughout, there are echoes of When Animals Dreams, which is actually a decent Scandinavian coming of age cum werewolf movie. A chaste and sanitized ghost of American Werewolf in London is somewhere in there, too.There's a bit of teenage family drama thrown in, there's young love, both of which don't take the story anywhere.The dialogue is very bad, the production bland, the overall look is that of a minor TV movie. There are multiple goofs and continuity issues.Worst of all, the movie is a bore."
300,Viking Wolf,A good norwegian thriller/horrror,6,"I have to hand it to the norwegians, they always seem to have some of the best movies and this is no different. It was fun and intriging to watch. The cast were pretty good though I cant compare them to other films that they were in., but from what i can see here they were great. This movie is all about a young girl named Thale. One day after hanging out with friends by the bay, she is attacked along with others, that one bite changes her, and not for the best. What we come to is a stand off with other wolves. There is quite a bit of blood shed as a warning but I liked the mystery of it all and the atmosphere built up worked. Overall an enjoyable norwegian thriller."
301,Viking Wolf,Not self contained,1,"I like it when a world is self contained. It can be most absurd or fantastic if its characters live in this world, take it ""serious"" and act like it. This film builds a world but its characters don't stick to it. This keeps dragging the viewer out of the story. The one that got me was the hunter. Spoiler! Near the end he drives full throttle in a store front where the werewolf stands. A man that was established as a hunter that hunts werewolf for all his life. Confronts the werewolf unprepared. As if. This scene really ruined the movie for me. It blatantly took the world it spent 1,5 hours to build and slapped it into the viewers face. Why? Because its a ""cool action scene""? Disappointing."
302,Viking Wolf,When are we going to get another good Werewolf movie?,4,"What could be lurking in the dense forest or in old shafts?As a child you have a thriving imagination when it comes to monsters, as an adult you have often seen the real monster.But that's not what this is about, it's about classic stuff woven into the icy mythology of the Vikings.What initially creates an eerie, cold atmosphere later turns out to be a rather bland filmed story with sometimes strange moments.A big problem here are the effects, often the scenes are completely ridiculously exaggerated.Almost an embarrassing battle record.Unfortunately, the short scary moments cannot carry a whole film.A real shame."
303,Viking Wolf,Trash,1,"Well it started off poorly and it was all downhill from then on. Seriously how can Netflix churn out such rubbish time and time again? I'd say 99% of their output is totally unwatchable, similar to an old Video Store in the '80s with shelves and shelves of Z List movies peppered with the (very) occasional decent film yet they're looked on as if they're the greatest thing to happen to TV since John Logie Baird. The simple solution is for them concentrate on quality over quantity, but will it happen? Don't hold your breath. As for Viking Wolf, well don't bother and go and read a good book instead."
304,Viking Wolf,Viking Wolf,7,"As this Norwegian film opens we are told how, almost a thousand years ago, Viking raiders heading south to Normandy. In a monastery they find a fearsome wolf like 'hell hound'. They take it with them as they return... none of the Vikings survive and the creature swims ashore. In the present day teenage girl Thale, and her family, have just moved to the remote Norwegian town where her mother, Liv, has joined the local police. One evening Thale sneaks out of her house to attend a beach party. Another girl is attacked and dragged off by a creature, Thale is scratched. Liv leads the investigation and soon finds what appears to be a wolf's claw. When the body is found it appears to have been attacked by a large, savage animal. An eccentric hunter turns up claiming the creature is in fact a werewolf!I thought this was a decent enough addition to the werewolf genre. The prologue made it clear that this was going to be a werewolf film from the opening scene. Part of me would have preferred that information to come out a bit later but it didn't matter too much as it wasn't long before we knew what had attacked the girl. Apart from explaining how werewolves originally came to be in Scandinavia it didn't try to add anything to the established lore. The plot borrows from other films; most obviously 'An American Werewolf in London' but also from less obvious sources... I'm sure the hunter was inspired by Quint from 'Jaws'. The effects are decent enough and the acting was solid. The big question about any horror film is 'Is it scary?' unfortunately for the most part it isn't. While we see a bit of the aftermath of attacks the makers seemed a bit squeamish about showing the gory attacks. Overall a decent enough addition to the genre that fans of werewolf movies are likely to enjoy. Even if they don't rate it amongst the best they are unlikely to consider it one of the worst.These comments are based on watching the film in Norwegian with English subtitles."
305,Viking Wolf,Entertaining ok yet nothing special,5,"If u were a werewolf fan, I honestly tell u that it's a far cry from the Underworld franchise with Kate Beckinsale (Selene) nor Teen Wolf with O'Brien. Its Nordic style gave me an exotic impression, which was the only thing that kept me on my seat.It has severely limited SFX, and a fairy thin n straight forward plot. Each character is not fully developed and none of their role is compelling. For the whole movie time I totally didn't understand why Liv gotta work almost alone as a police officer. I couldn't feel any love in the movie, regardless the family one not the fancy one. The university lecturer/ vet seemed more like a junior lab tech. Expert, seriously? The director should have chosen a more seriously-looking actor (e.g. Imagine Tom Cruise). And then the old man werewolf hunter looked like an amateur. Get someone looks like Sean Connery please! And how boredom was his advices!!!! Just silver bullets n habitats. Any movie fan can tell her more! Twist? None at all. Ending? What a vague ending. I surmise the director also got fell flat and didn't wanna have a sequel. Thus forget about any cliffhanger.Lastly but not the least, the werewolf looked plastic to me. It's fake, lame, absurd, and def not a scary one.After all it's Ok as an entertainment, B-class, for 1-1/2 hr. Don't expect anything else."
306,Viking Wolf,Why does this have a low score!!!?,9,"I swear a lot of people have poor taste or have been COMPLETELY programmed by regular, subpar, run-of-the-mill mainstream nonsense, that their minds have melted or they're in a perpetual state of discombobulation.Put simply; this film is brilliant!! It's simple, well acted, and is not ruined by the insertion of the most-prevalent western Alphabet agenda.This is brilliant! I don't get the hate!... simple is better, in most cases.Nowadays we're fed big-budget nonsense, that forces an agenda or two but is unbearable, at which point it becomes a pointless watch.This film snuck up on me; I found myself feeling so sad for the girl.When her little sister recognised her while she was in werewolf form and said, ""I can help you..."" I cried uncontrollably.Don't listen to the other reviews; listen to me; watch this: you will not be disappointed. This film is decent! Simple, but decent."
307,Viking Wolf,A Werewolf in Norway,3,"Another entry in the well worn genre of the werewolf. This time around, the beast is in a village in Norway.A high school girl is partying with a group of friends when one of them is killed by a werewolf. She is wounded and the rest is predictable.Her mom just happens to be a police officer who is in charge of the investigation. She resents her step dad but loves her mute sister and they communicate using sign language. I just love the Hallmark movie moment in this tedious drama.A veterinarian is recruited to analyze the wounds on the first victim and he declares the death to be from an attack by a larger than usual wolf.Silver bullets are introduced and this train wreck has a silly ending. Do not waste your time on this Viking bore."
308,Viking Wolf,Wonder Woman v The Werewolf,4,"Anyone with only a basic understanding of folklore knows if a victim survives a werewolf bite, well, beware the next full moon. As the body count mounts, including a bus-load of passengers either mauled or killed by the beast, there are no extra police brought in at any time, even after hunters, a press photographer, an asylum seeker, and the police chief are torn to shreds. By the way, the big burly police chief can't stomach the medical examination of the first victim, leaving the female coroner and the female cop to poke through the remains. He is scared witless in the woods upon seeing a corpse and instructs the female cop to take charge of the hunt. The animal expert sent to examine the bodies looks as though he is still going through puberty.The female mayor is held back from seeing what's left of her daughter's mangled body yet recovers quickly enough to give a chirpy little speech to the townsfolk. A grizzled old man who knows all about werewolves drives his truck through a big glass window and almost kills the vet and the cop who were holding it closed. The cop's house-husband is left bleeding and slumped over the wheel of his car.....he is never seen or heard of again......
The most risible scene must be when the wolf has the cop pinned to the ground, it's massive fangs sink deep into the flesh and bone of her arm, it's jaws gnawing down on the limb and in a sort of conversational way, she calls out to the vet for help. Very soon she is driving home, both arms intact and able to hang up her coat, despite the fact one arm had been broken in her first brush with the wolf earlier on in the film.Also, what of those bitten but survived? Oh dear...what will happen in four weeks time?"
309,Viking Wolf,It was ok.,6,"I spent the first half of the film thinking how dull and boring it was, we didn't see the werewolf and the murder scenes were largely covered up, so I was losing my patience and thinking about turning it off, but because of the good acting of the young girl and the hope it would get more exciting I stuck with it.In a way I'm glad I did because things did start to happen, we saw the werewolf, which was pretty good CGI, and the changing scene was also very well done.At the end I was quite satisfied, but I still haven't seen a recent werewolf that's impressed me to the point where I'm on the edge of my seat, the last one that achieved that was Late Phases.I've said this before and I'll say it again, please please please someone make a good scary werewolf film, please."
310,Viking Wolf,Damn those Vikings!,4,"The title Viking Wolf basically reveals everything you need to know about this movie. Greedy vikings back in the day released a hound from hell which made it's way into the Nordic woods. Cut to the present time, it continues to wreck havoc by attacking annoying teenagers. Barring the initial hype created with the Vikings scene, the story follows the routine narrative wrt werewolf movies. A family which has newly moved into the small town and the rebellious teen daughter being her annoying best to be rude to her mom and new step dad. There's a deaf sister too who for the plot's sake only becomes relevant in the final act and ofcourse the mother is a cop.Netflix got me intrigued enough to watch this one due to the trending. Anyways it was indeed a predictable age old werewolf movie, just that this one is Norwegian. There were several convenient plot points throughout cutting the tension. It is less gory too compared to other similar films. What I did enjoy was the final act especially the scene on the bus which is why I am going with a lenient rating. If they had explored more of the daughter's character and her equation with her mother then the end result could have been better. Unfortunately the characterization was just not effective enough to root for both the main characters."
311,Viking Wolf,Stellar Werewolf CGI.,10,"Viking Wolf is a stunner! The CGI werewolves in this film are some of the best I've seen in a very long time and the story line tied in with legend is purely exhilarating. A very unique thrill ride with all kinds of twists and turns but provides the adrenaline rush monster lovers seek when looking for films of similar merit. I think this one, similarly to Cursed, are probably some of the best that have come out in recent years. I like the originality of the Norwegian legend telling the origins of the beast's release and how the introduction worked to build a mythical backstory within a contemporary setting.10 stars! ✨"
312,Viking Wolf,Oh dear.,1,"So right off I'm going to admit that I couldn't make it through the whole movie. I want to be honest and say this review is based on how much I did watch.Some great movies have come out of Norway but this is certainly not one of them. The title alone is a misrepresentation of what the movie is actually about.If it was called ""Moody Teenager"" it would be much closer to the reality if what this movie is.The acting by the main part of the cast is just awful. Their pacing is so off it's like one person delivers a line and then someone who replies has to wait 30 seconds. Not for tension. Just normal conversation. It's ridiculous.I am surprised to be actually writing this but ""Troll"" suddenly became not that bad in comparison and I thought that was terrible until seeing this.Dismissed."
313,Viking Wolf,Was worth watching...,5,"I start out by saying that I like watching movies from other countries as they often have actors and filming locations that I've never seen. It does make it harder to evaluate the acting as you don't know if something you don't like is bad acting, bad direction or more a reflection of the culture the actor comes from. I say that as I liked the movie but found most of the characters subdued and not very friendly at any time in the movie. So I'd want more character and emotions but that might not be a Norwegian trait.The movie does derive from other werewolf movies but I still found parts of it fresh. I thought the modern approach to werewolves was better then most of what I've seen lately.There are plot holes as with any movie but I didn't really notice many until it was over. Although the crashing RV seemed out of the blue. And how do citizens get to crime scenes faster than other police?I like the ending, not only for its potential, or not, twist but also had the feeling that the police officer/mother was coming home to an empty house.Not a movie that you'll likely watch again in the near future but worth a watch now."
314,Viking Wolf,FAR BETTER THAN THE REVIEWS,7,I felt the need to review this film because of the low number that it currently has. It was an enjoyable and entertaining film with good acting. While the plot is somewhat predictable it's still worth watching. The Norwegian actors and scenery are a refreshing change from so many of the current films online and it gets your interest quickly and turns into an exciting thriller and I never felt let down. It has supernatural elements that develop early on in the story and the female police officer is trying to come to terms with evidence that doesn't seem possible under normal circumstances. She finally is confronted with a choice that's difficult to face!
315,Viking Wolf,Like a mangy dog,1,"Really silly, cliched werewolf movie. It's all there - the miserable teenage daughter (played by an actress who looks around 25) who is all angsty because her mother married again, the cute little sister who is a mute, the female police chief who goes all feminine and helpless at times of crisis. And the horribly fake-looking CGI wolf, although it is at least marginally better than the plastic dog in ""Gingersnaps"". Then there is the ""expert veterinarian"" (who looks about 14) who turns out to be an expert in werewolves too, and the gnarled old hunter with the funny accent who has been trying to eliminate ""the curse"" forever, yet is completely unprepared when he meets the wolf face to face. And don't let's forget the two men who are guarding a body in the woods; they are both armed to the teeth, but when the wolf shows up they just stand there looking at it until it kills them.Really, really bad - don't waste your time. This movie is about as exciting as a mangy dog."
316,Viking Wolf,Dog Bite,5,"I can see how some reviews comparing the film to a cluster of other horror films with bits and pieces sawn up together to make up the ""Vikinggulven"". Some may disagree but, I personally think that having been inspired by other films is not the problem until it becomes imitational. And it is not what happened in this film.Although the subject matter- werewolf is beaten to death through the past 5 decades, almost all possible ploys are consumed and endings feel like regurgitations of the same. Take for example a similar topic of zombies. The 1st zombie movie that has ever been made believed to be directed by Victor Halperin named ""White Zombie"" in 1936. However, the worldwide introduction of this particular spectacle is achieved by the director George A. Romero with the release of ""Night of the Living Dead"" in 1968. Since then according to Wikipedia, over 570 zombie-themed movies were released by the end of 2021.Accordingly, motion pictures that are made with the same brand of themes are similar in architecture, ambiance, character design, dialogs, and monologs as well as spaces (cities or small towns, forests or underground places, etc)Nonetheless, it is not unexpected for viewers to find similarities in this film and the others when a topic is so exhaustingly used up. However, the acting is ok, directing good, the writing is standard and CGI is good for a small-budget film. However, it's predictable, forgettable yet watchable.My suggestions for the writers and directors as well as wannabes create a new object and objective. Give it a few similar yet quite unfamiliar traits. Use your imagination. Don't give people what they want. Give them what they can not expect!"
317,Viking Wolf,The story that could have been told in 30 minutes takes 1 hour extra!,4,"First of all, i really wanted to like this movie. I even skipped watching it's trailer so to enjoy the movie without knowing anything about it.The problems are plenty here, 1st is the movie isn't even sure what it wants to be either a horror or a drama and succeeds in neither department. You don't feel about any character. You just wait and wait for things to happen bt nothing.. only in the last 30 minutes does the movie picks some pace. And no it's not a slowburner or anything like that, just plain irritating to this point. Performances are okay, nothing exceptional. The problem is you don't watch these movies for performances or decent story , you just wanna have some silly fun and spend the time. You won't believe that there's is almost no violence and gore in this supposed to be ""werewolf"" movie. And coming to the actual ""werewolf"" of this movie the lesser we talk about it is better, it looks like something from a low budget video game. Overall this movie was a disappointment of epic proportions., Probably one of the worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen."
318,Viking Wolf,Stupidty in all they do - worst plot ever,1,"If you want to check the most stupid movies of Warewolf of all time, I bet this is a close one. Not even considered a ""teen movie"" - the plot is so stupid and had huge holes everywhere that it is outrageous. Police woman is as stupid as her daughter, she suspects her daughter was infected and find her daughter best friend killed and she did nothing. She doesn't try to contact her daughter. The girls know she is a wolf, and contact no one for help. She takes a bus to run away, nonsense. Bus enters a tunnel that later has no lights. The experimented hunter, uses a van to try to kill the animal, before he advices only way was silver bullets. Animal tranquilizer does nothing first, then it takes it down in 2 secs. Vet shoots a tranquilizer then run. All non sense. Don't waste time."
319,Viking Wolf,Ginger Snaps + Heterochromy = Viking Wolf,2,"After reading the movietitle I first though about a girl which get's biten by a viking, so she can become a mighty ancient scandinavian warrior at night called Vikingulven (the original title) ;-) That would have been a fresh horror movie. But after watching the first minutes, I realized this nearly as an 1:1-copy of 'Ginger snaps' (alas 10 mins schorter). I'm the guy who doesn't like remakes, because they are most of the time a poor impression of the original movie. So there have to be some extraordinary special effects or surprising turns to make that movie worth it's money. Yeah, there are some good CGIs and ambitioned actors, thats why I gave two stars. But using the same plot and only giving the main character (which also looks the same as Ginger) two eye colors doesn't qualify as an independent movie. The money making it would be better spent on Doctors Without Borders or Greenpeace or..."
320,Viking Wolf,some of the...,4,"Worst ive seen coming outta my countrys film-''industry'', it lacks so much, and that maybe due to the fact that the plot idea couldve been an international blockbuster...allthough im negative in the start, you will be awarded with some decent and scenic natural camerashoots of norwegian environment, you will be amazed by the quality on the special effects, especially the werewolf, and the wound makeup of the victims...but the way they tell this story is a cathastrophee en masse', the cast of actors look like theyve forgotten their lines and stutters till full stop, so the script must be a failure, and the willingness of the director to do tiring retakes till the product is perfect are totally absent. The '' cut and glue'' guy on the production line appears not to have been at the actual shooting scenes, and have done the matter just reading the screenplay...so with a fair amount of goodwill i wont offer more than a 4 outta 10 for this film, i agree with loads of the reviews ive seen on the olin'e, a no recommend from the grumpy old man."
321,Viking Wolf,Norwegian nonsense?,7,"So it's been a while since I've seen a really good werewolf movie, the last time I indulged was the woeful and laughable 'werewolves within' (don't bother).With a couple of hours to kill, pardon the pun I took a look at viking wolf which to be fair sounded like typical Norwegian nonsense but I'll be honest I was pleasantly surprised!I liked the back story although explained in subtitles as its in Norwegian remember and from then on dubbed English which to be fair was really good for a change.So to the story itself 17 year old thane is mauled by a wolf in the woods after witnessing two friends mauled and killed and slowly begins her metamorphosis into a werewolf, her mother who is a local police officer has to track down the original wolf that mauled her daughter and comes to realise with the help of a werewolf hunter what her daughter will become.All in all its a very good tale with excellent cgi and all the cast play out their parts with gusto, OK it could have been better but for what it was I enjoyed it and there may be some room for a sequel as the ending is left open!"
322,Viking Wolf,The Norvegians suprises again!,8,Yet again the north suprises with a good horror movie! Late in 22 we had Troll and before that Dead snow.A young girl gets wounded in a werewolf attack in norway.While her mum wich is a police tries to hunt the werewolf the young girl starts to show..wolfy tendensies.Great practical effects that echo Rick Bakers American werewolf and the CGI isnt bad either. Unfortunately i watched the dubbed version wich sounds..odd to be mild. But other than that its a real treat for fans of Werewolf movies.Went in with low expectations and was really suprised! Got gore and atmosphere! Highly recommended.
323,Viking Wolf,It's about time ...,10,"The problem with the werewolf films is they generally fail to stand up to the well known . That's usually a budget issue, resulting in a poor script, average acting, so so directing and the lack of the money shot -- the obligatory transformation scene. Basically, you can usually see the money running out as the film progresses, leaving no bite for the third act.Enter Netflix, it would seem their pockets are deep enough to make a worthy addition with Vikinggulven (Viking Wolf). Actually, this is a surprisingly good addition to the genre, a perfectly fine plot which wasn't too caught up in subterfuge, which is usually a bad sign in werewolf films, so no guessing as to who the wolf protagonist is, just tension as to when they will figure it out for themselves so we can start with the real fun ... the wolf.Excellent CGI has been around for nearly 30 years now. First of all dinosaurs, then meteors and space aliens, but they still didn't have the rendering skill to produce hair, and those wolves in the late 90's through the early 2000's didn't really look right unless there was a mix of traditional effects and CGI. However, now they've got that one down even for lower medium budget films, and the wolves are acceptable enough. This one was well conceived, the transformation scene and the resultant animal is good enough to pass the test.The rest of it: a reasonably decent plot, good acting and a perfectly fine job by the director leads to a suitable third act for any werewolf film buff with plenty of blood and guts and many minutes of onscreen wolfery which should satisfy even the genres most ardent critics.Of course, there will always be those that require levels of perfection that even Netflix budgets won't deliver, hence the propensity to score 1/10, which should only really be given in dire and rare circumstances though I see it all the time, even with even big budget movies that can't be scored less than a 5/10 (= watchable in my book). So to balance that out, I will be scoring 10 for everything that I think is worth more than a 5/10 - hence my official score for this is a 10, though I think I would have scored 8 in reality.Whatever the case, give it a shot. If you like werewolf films, you won't be disappointed."
324,Blood,A new poker tell for reviews,6,"A hit and a miss. Michelle Monaghan is great. A decade ago, you could find her in literally every romcom coming out of Tinseltown, playing the love interest on the distaff side. Props to her for successfully maintaining a career in drama films like this one, films that rely entirely on acting chops. And Brad Anderson has forgotten more about sci-fi than most creators today actually know, another veteran. Blood is an eponymous title, and yes the viewers get what they pay for. But, acting aside, the story is not satisfying and the characters continually make bad choices -- which can be distressing for theater patrons expecting a fun ride. Notice also the new metric for the reviews -- count the number of fake-tens that the producers use to salt the early ratings, and that shows you the confidence that the studio has in its own product.

325,Blood,Pretty Bad,4,"Blood is about Owen, a young boy (Finlay Wojtak-Hissong), being watched on by his older sister Tyler (Skylar Morgan Jones) and his mom Jess (Michelle Monaghan). They just moved in the middle of nowhere where there is horror afoot. Until one night, their dog bites Owen in the middle of the night that gives him a virus where he needs to drink blood in order to survive. The mom is willing to sacrifice anything in her life to make Owen live happy again by giving him as much blood as possible.Overall, I tried to stay positive throughout this movie because I liked the acting, but that was it. The acting only made me watch the film because it is pointless and pretty slow as well. I thought it would pick up in the ending because I yawned in the middle of the film, but the ending is not good as well that I felt bad for the characters. Would recommend to stay away from this film because it is slow, pointless, and boring."
326,Blood,Don't Waste Your Time,2,"I agree completely with the reviewer that said this movie was boring, pointless, and slow. I'm not sure what got lost in the sauce because the acting really was GOOD. The Director also seems to have done their job well and the sound was creepy enough too. It certainly proves just how far a mother will go to save her child. But unfortunately the movie had me wishing that the brat would just DIE already!I have no idea why someone said this is one of the most disturbing films they had ever seen. I've seen movies way more mentally disturbing and depraved than this. What was disturbing was how stupid the movie really was. Maybe they all just really liked the writer? I dunno. This is one of the movies I wish I had just listed to the reviews instead of the ridiculously high star rating."
327,Blood,"Don't trust the 10/10 reviews, brand new accounts",4,"If you click on the accounts that gave 10/10 you'll see that they were all created in the last couple of days as of this comment.A friend works in the industry and it's standard business practice now for production companies to outsource reviews to people that just make accounts all day and copy and paste glowing reviews. If you look at the text a lot of it is just generic praise. It's most obvious when the first few reviews are out and they're all 10/10, but in a week these get buried and it's harder to tell how skewed the actual user rating is. I'm sure a lot of you know this, but the few that don't I thought I'd post this because it's become more blatant every year on every site."
328,Blood,A searing condemnation of.....,3,"...marriage, divorce, procreation, poor parenting, adultery, the legal system, drought, addiction, farming, mental health, negligent pet ownership, euthanasia, overworked medical professionals, bureaucracy, olives in pasta sauces, lax leash laws, hospice, dumb (but cute) cops, rampant truancy, pernicious anemia, sibling rivalry, step-sibling cookery, mud-based filicide, holes in dead evil trees (or Evil Dead trees), seductive nannies, Carhartt jackets on guys over 50, overpriced/undersized oak caskets, woefully slow film-making and prepubescent rural pseudo-vampirism as a metaphorical and literal depiction of the incontrovertible fact that all children are blood-sucking and ruinous creatures from birth.I fast-forwarded through chunks of the movie and still got all that from it. I felt bad for the dog because he was named Pippin and in this movie and got blamed for stuff that was clearly the fault of the writer and director. It was too much, too familiar, too slow, too this and too that."
329,Blood,One of the rare good horror flicks,8,"If you're like me and you're done with the tired old horror flick template of jump scares that aren't scary, sewn closed mouths in mirrors, etc., and you find yourself riveted to your couch by the slow burn dread and horror of movies like Hereditary, the VVitch, the Ritual and so on, then Blood should be as good for you as it was for me. There are some truly creepy scenes, it's well written (mostly, more on that in a sec), and the characters are believable and interesting. My only complaint is the lack of explanation regarding the tree. That's just kind of left hanging... on the other hand, it, along with the post credits scene may be setting up a sequel??? If so, I'll be watching it."
330,Blood,Dark Trip,7,"I like this one - it takes us on a grotesque and absurd trip, drags us in a dark tale and into the void of growing madness. Michelle Monaghan gives a fine and emotional performance, the rest of the cast, including the kids, does also well. Different than some other reviewers I don't mind that the ""reason"" for the dark and twisted happenings is not revealed - make up your mind yourself, the experienced connoisseur of the art of horror (be it books or movies) can easy fill the blanks. What else? Blood reminds me of Hereditary or The Witch, movies that takes us along on a dark, disturbing path, where in the end something awaits us that we don't expect."
331,Blood,"Maybe not the horror movie of the year, but interesting at times.",6,"The characters do not behave like morons. The behavior of people quite sensible for the situation. There is nothing explicitly expressed here, there is a strange problem with the child and the mother who, according to her, does everything to keep her son alive without considering the consequences. For a B-grade cinema, this is quite an interestingly developed plot of supporting characters. The biggest drawback is probably that it's not very scary. On the plus side, there is a slight suggestion at the end of the film that maybe we didn't quite see the same thing as the main character, but I think it's more of an attempt by the medical services to justify the phenomenon in general. As for me 6/10, not great not terrible, I do not regret that I watched it but do i recommend it? I don't know."
332,Blood,Michelle Monaghan in one the most disturbing film ever,4,"I loved THE MACHINIST but was mixed by BLOOD. The film has great elements, first Michelle Monaghan is phenomenal and her performance is really great, engaging as a mother who is ready to literally everything to support and heal his child. Also the two children are every great. The script is far from being flawless, but is full of suspense, tension and strong relationships between the characters.BLOOD is also one of the most disturbing film you'll ever see. It can be disgusting at moments, though there is no gore (but lots of, well, blood, in this film. What's unhealthy, and really disturbing is the character's decisions and actions, and Monaghan's character, just like us, knows from the very beginning that what she's doing is wrong. She can be seen as a mother who loves and cherishes her child, and also, as someone says in the movie, ""a monster"". That's really disturbing. And her actions become unbelievable at some points. Of course, the supernatural element here is only a pretext to think about: ""how far would you fo for your child?"".Still, there is a feeling that something is unfinished here, probably due due to some unanswered questions, but we feel it goes beyond these.BLOOD is a film you'll love or hate. What's sure is that you'll probably feel very uncomfortable, and be shocked watching this film. Whatever you'll like or hate it, you won't forget it, and you'll probably need to walk 20/30 minutes to absorb the experience."
333,Blood,wow...,8,"I cant phatom what amount of story and joy a handful of blood can make on the great big silverscreen , its no irony that blood is thicker than water and that its iron taste may make some people go freaked out, in a bloodfamily that has enough to deal with from before...a really different horrorthriller on the bloody banks of the lake behind the house starts a medical issue that only will be treated with rawblood taken per os. When non other than human blood is good enough than deliveryproblems becomes an issue. It then raises the question of motherhood, how far fetched will she be when trying to help and hide her methods???This was a decent and thrilling story about blood, in many aspects, its not a vampire story even though you may feel that. The acting is very good, the score hangs like a swollen appendix to a well driven plotspeed, and most of all its not too gory, but still not as cosy as a lifetime drama.The most squemish out there will crave more blood and gore, and may complane about some trails left behind and plotholes to fill, and to a surtain degree i can agree to that, therefore just an 8 from the grumpy old man, its still a solid flick and there maybe a sequel to it..."
334,Blood,Fake negative reviews! Don't be fooled!,9,"Saw a couple of fake reviews, telling that the good reviews are the fake ones. Like come on seriously? As a movie critic I am concerned about the amount of fake reviews giving a false indication about how a movie is.I saw the trailer and it looks good. Not sure why these people were complaining about slow paced, boring or whatever. This movie is GOOD. Not excellent of course. But GOOD.The acting is excellent. Sure, the movie goes a bit slow, but I have watched a much slower paced movies that made me sleep. This movie is not that bad.Jess (Michelle) and both her childrens acting are on point. Kudos to the director honestly. And quite the comeback by Skeet.If you watch this movie expecting a straight horror movie, you'd be disappointed. But this isn't a straight up horror movie. It is a Horror + Drama movie... which is kind of a fresh make up of real life drama and intertwined with horror/supernatural.My final say is, ignore the low ratings, and Go for it. You won't regret it. I loved this movie."
335,Blood,Only disturbing thing is the dog being killed,1,"That was disturbing, shocking , unnecessary!Why do they have to kill the dog!The boy was annoying. Didnt feel anything for him. Only when he looked for the dog in the beginning then I liked him.Naming a girl Tyler to suite the abcde ppl was also sidturbing to me.It could have been better cause I like other movies from Brad Anderson but je clearly has a fetisch of using dogs in his movies and making them aggressive like in fractured wanting to hurt a child. Whats he aiming at here, I wonder.Nothing to see here though unless you habe nothing to watch and just want to see what new movies are out there then go for it."
336,Blood,"Watchable, but somewhat boring actually...",4,"When I stumbled upon this 2022 horror/thriller titled ""Blood"", I must admit that I wasn't initially impressed with the movie's cover. But with it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to find the time to sit down and watch it.Writer Will Honley churned out a semi-adequate script for the movie. There were some interesting aspects to the storyline, for sure. However, the narrative was just too slow paced and there simply wasn't enough of things happening throughout the course of the 108 minutes to keep it all that thrilling and interesting actually. So director Brad Anderson just didn't really have all that much of a proper script to work with really.The acting performances in ""Blood"" were fair enough, taking into consideration the limitations imposed on the actresses and actors.Visually then you're not in for anything outstanding. But then again, ""Blood"" wasn't a movie that really relied heavily on having special effects. So the lack of impressive and bedazzling effects wasn't really a hindrance to the movie.While I managed to sit through the entire movie, I have to admit that ""Blood"" just didn't have the stuff that mattered, and that made it a somewhat boring movie to sit through, especially since it took director
Brad Anderson forever to set the stage for the final 15 minutes of the movie.My rating of ""Blood"" lands on a generous four out of ten stars."
337,Blood,I didn't like it.,4,"Too many things wrong with this film. The film never reveals the secrets of the tree. Jess, as. Helen said, is a total monster. She is a bigger monster than what her son has become. She has a drug problem, ruined her marriage, neglects her children and takes her kids away from the other parent that is capable of providing care for them. Despite this, she is given custody of her two children because she is the mother.When her son becomes sick with an unexplained illness that turns him into a vampire like creature after he is bitten by the infected family pet, she hides his illness from the doctors in the hospital she works in. Out of her own selfishness and ego , she decides to feed her child human blood which she knows is unsustainable. At first, she illegally obtains the blood from the hospital's freezer that stores blood for patients, then animal blood from rabbits she purchased at a pet store, she feeds her son her own blood until that also isn't sustainable, then she kidnaps a terminally ill elderly woman who only has 6 months to live from an undisclosed cancer. She robs the poor elderly woman from her few days of life to satisfy her motherly ego by drawing her blood to feed her son.. She knows this will eventually end with the death of the old woman and she traumatizes her daughter with her decisions. Her son dies anyway but with a ton of collateral damage in her wake. Again, Helen said it best, Jes is a monster. The boy might have lived if given proper medical care.The flick is a vampire film without the ""vampire"". It reminded me a little of ""Let the Right One In (2008)"" in which in that film, a caretaker for the vampire kills and brings back blood for a young-looking girl that is hundreds of year-old vampire. But again, here, the film doesn't go into vampire lore. But it's the same concept of feeding a blood thirsty monster.I didn't like the film because I found the character, Jess, reprehensible and the story wasn't fleshed out well. The story of the tree is never revealed so we are left with nothing. The ending seems to imply or leave room for a possible sequel when the story seems to repeat itself with a new family pet that is at the brink of becoming infected. But this time the three has been burnt down. I really hope there isn't a sequel. This film was a waste of time. It felt like it would be a good film. Almost felt like an A24 horror in the beginning. But it didn't go anywhere. I didn't like it."
338,Blood,It's better than what many reviews rate,10,"Michelle Monaghan is one of my favorites. It's unusual (for me) to see her in a role like this- part monster and all mother. I suppose every mother could potentially become a monster in order to protect her kid.The movie is indeed a horror. It begins as a drama and develops as a thriller, eventually it results in horror. I liked the pace, although I found myself easily distracted early on. But, as the flick progressed, I found myself glued to the edge of my seat.I would anticipate a sequel of some sort (or a prequel) because the myth has not been established; that is, what the origin and nature of the evil is..."
339,Blood,Cliché,4,"Blood is a 2023 American horror film directed by Brad Anderson and written by Will Honley. The film stars Michelle Monaghan and Skeet Ulrich.Blood was released in theaters on January 27, 2023 by Vertical Entertainment.Although I love Michelle Monaghan, the movie is so clichéd that after a while you get into the ""what am I watching"" mode.I think the biggest mistake of the movie is the path it follows, I'm not sure if the director or producer has decided this now, but the scenario Monaghan said okay and the scenario we are watching now is not the same, I am sure of that.Sometimes it's obvious that even Monagan is so bored."
340,Blood,Good movie for timepass,4,"That's all i've to say
just a timepass
watch this if you have a lot of time to spare.It was pretty slow imo.Ending wasn't clear.I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS
like how was the virus formed or where was it from. We all know the boy got it from the dog but where did he get it from? It wasn't even explained properly. The acting was really good tho so hats off to that. But the story was really unsettling especially the ending. Really slow and boring. It got creepy here and there but wasn't scary overall. The story wasn't complete tbh, left me hanging with a lot of questions.So my conclusion, you can watch something way better than this meaning this is a complete waste of time."
341,Blood,Slow Burning Thriller with Vampire Characteristics,10,"I have read other reviews before watching.I don't like slasher movies, and this is not one.More Vampire style. You will know the synopsis by now.The acting is very good by all in the movie.There is a story in this although unpleasant and I see a similarity with Pet Sematary by Stephen King.I enjoyed the watch, it pulled you in.If you like a slow burning thriller, you will enjoy this as I did.The story is based on a lake, albeit empty and tried up now, with something evil in the tree leading to the dog being aware something was going on the tree in the middle. Whatever is in the tree, we don't find out but the curious dog ends up being rabid and biting the young son Owen. He ends up being rabid too and can only survive by drinking blood, human, animal or otherwise.Mother is a doctor and has access to blood in the beginning of the boys issue and the story takes you from there.It's a good watch for 1:40mins."
342,Blood,I actually liked this,10,"This was better than I thought it would be. The acting was great. I liked that the characters acted the way you would expect them to act and not like your typical scary movie idiots. This older sister acts so much like my teenage daughter and the boy like my 11 year old boy that I felt like I could really relate to how the mom did things. It was pretty slow but I felt like that added to the story. It was very well done. When starting it don't go into it expecting true horror, this isn't really that. You feel all of the emotions except fear. I will probably watch it again with my teen, but other than that not something I would watch over and over."
343,Blood,Blown away,10,"I went in not expecting much but the trailer had me intrigued so I gave it a shot. What I got was maybe one of the all time great thriller/horror films. Hands down one of the best flicks I've seen in some time. Superb acting, along with a great plot with good pacing. This film never lets down and keeps you on your toes. Rarely can a film have you feeling sympathy for a someone who kidnaps and tortures her. But Brad Anderson is a masterful director. I hope there's a sequel because I'm very much interested in seeing the origin of the tree. I can say enough how blown away I am at this film.I really don't know what other people are seeing, because this was an excellent movie."
344,Blood,A lovely new twist on horror films,10,"This movie was absolutely great. My family and I loved it. My kids couldn't stop talking about it once we got home. Every actor in the film did an amazing job. My daughters favorite was the actress who played Tyler. She wouldn't stop talking about her on the way home. It was very creative and I thought at first it might be like every other horror film, but to my surprise it brought me in. No horror movie has ever been so captivating. I'm so grateful that they chose a new twist for this horror film. It gave us a new spin on a classic fright fest. I hope they continue to make more horror films like this in the future."
345,Blood,Woefully anemic,4,"Examining Brad Anderson's back catalog, it's almost heretical to state that Blood is in desperate need of thrills. This is a guy that has given us the likes of The Machinist, TransSiberian or Session 9 - all competent, albeit disposable genre fares. Anderson is clearly trying to capitalize on his strengths here - the moody and evocative cinematography, simple yet relatable themes, and committed performances from his leads - but they never coalesce into something consistently engaging. The trailer is probably the most rousing aspect of this picture - a masterclass of false advertising promising a gloomy, vampiric take on a child gone bad and containing most of the movie's memorable scenes. Yet the final product is more Room than The Good Son, a plodding tale of a loving mother that is too languid and ludicrous to sustain any kind of dramatic heft. Much like the child she nourishes, it's an insipid piece that only sporadically springs to life - and it will take more than a few pints of blood to fix."
346,Blood,I want to know more about the tree!,10,"To answer the question ""how far would a mother go?"" I have to say that I thought I knew, as a mom of two, how far I would go to save or protect either of them. The movie really left me questioning my own answer to that! Michelle Monaghan did a great job balancing the hectic and somber life of a newly divorced mom while exposing the underbelly of a human being's primal tendencies to protect her young. At what point is ""too far"" actually too far to save your own child?Skylar Morgan Jones perfectly portrayed the daughter who has been burdened with a secret no child should have to carry about her own brother. Skeet Ulrich's character as her dad seems to be a good guy who loves his kids, and obviously worried about his ex-wife's stability and capacity to take care of their children on a day-to-day basis.Definitely want more backstory into what's up with that tree! I'm intrigued!Already planning to watch it again!"
347,Blood,WATCH NOW!!!,10,"OMG THIS MOVIE IS SO AMAZING!!! Go watch it right now. The acting was so good and so raw. It is so unbelievably incredible. When I watched this movie I could just tell how much hard work, time, and effort was put in to make it. If you have not seen it yet, please go watch. You will thank me later. 100% a 10/10 movie!!! Skylar Morgan Jones, Finlay Wojtak-Hissong, and Michelle Monaghan did such an amazing jobs. They are so talented and I can not wait to see what they will do in the future!!!Movie is out now! Do not wait. You will regret it if you don't watch this. I can't wait to see what these actors will i in the future but I'm sure that It'll be just as good or even better as they continue their path down an amazing career as an actor.Watch Blood. Out now!!!"
348,Infiesto,Flat and exploitative,5,"The plot follows the investigative police thriller style. We accompany detectives Samuel and Castro around the municipality of Piloña, Spain, in their investigation. However, the plot itself is simple and devoid of twists. Its linearity becomes an issue when we reach the climax.Part of the premise is that the investigation takes place at the time of the COVID pandemic, but that doesn't affect the plot. The pandemic is just a backdrop to the plot, present but indifferent. The plot tries to place the pandemic as a relevant factor, to the point of counting the days of confinement at the time when curfews and quarantines came into effect worldwide; the pandemic context seems to be just an artifice to attract an audience; the plot would remain the same without the pandemic.In the end, the feeling is one of exploitation, a twist that feels forced. Nothing in the plot indicates that that would be the end, the plot just plays a trick, an Ex-Machina that connects all the points, leaving us with the bitter taste of disassociation. The insinuations, the theories, all falls flat.The name of the film can only be premeditated. Infest.With a linear and simplistic plot, marked by a meaningless and calculated twist, and appropriating a historical moment that does not interfere with the plot, Infiesto should only be proud of its sepia cinematography of a decrepit Spanish region. The atmosphere is tense and suffocating, but the story is thin."
349,Infiesto,Noir Covid Thriller,8,"Infiesto: What at the outset looks like a film about a serial killer/kidnapping ring morphs into a Spanish Folk Horror thriller. It begins in march 2020 just as the covid lockdowns were first implemented. A girl who has been missing for nearly 3 months suddenly turns up. She has escaped from her abductors but is traumatised, remembers little. Two detectives who themselves are suffering from family separation due to the quarantines and curfews investigate the case and soon connect it to other missing young people. Strange characters are encountered and the obvious assumption is that a people trafficking gang is at work. But strange symbols are observed and the words of suspects suggest that a Cult with a hidden leader is involved. Sacrifices to appease an Old God, the coming of The End Times are all in the mix with the pandemic itself. The Asturias mountains where the detectives hunt for the Cult members and their victims provide a stark and eerie background. From old farm barns through the woods and pursuit along narrow roads, Cultists determined not to be taken alive must be pursued. Quite violent and gory in parts but much of the horror is psychological. This film could have been fleshed out and would have benefited from a twenty minute extension to it's 97 minute running time. Written and directed by Patxi Amezcua. On Netflix. 8/10."
350,Infiesto,An ok thriller,6,This was an alright spanish thriller. Iv'e seen bettee but as far as im concerned this was still great. For me however the only thing that let this movie down really was the dubbing. I didnt understand why it was overally acted and it therefor made the script sound a little unpolished aswell. But looking past that lets get to the actual film. Its all about this young girl that turns up after being missing for three months. The lead detectives try to find out who was responsible for the capture and within this find out it might be part of even bigger thing. The cast of this movie were good and interesting to watch. The plot was pretty good and was entertaining. Overall a pretty good thriller.
351,Infiesto,Failed thriller,3,"Infiesto is s small mining town in the province of Asturias, in northwest Spain. The time is the end of winter, a dark, rainy, melancholic season. The lead characters are Inspector Samuel (male) and Subinspector Castro (female). The movie opens with the roadside appearance of a teenager, alive, kidnapped long ago and presumed dead.The first half is rather good; it shows routine police work with frustrating leads, abundance of dead ends and uncooperative witnesses. It also shows in passing the heavy industry that pollutes the air and defiles the verdant, idyllic landscapes of Asturias with open pits, denuded hillsides and smokestacks.However, the story veers midway into horror movie territory. Improbabilities and impossibilities pile up and, what could have been a good police procedural slides into the (unintentionally) funny. Direction, cinematography and acting are good, but they can's cope with the material. The time frame of the action is the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and this is brought into play but is mostly inessential to the action.I was intrigued by the choice of a town with the strange name Infiesto. It is close to infesto (I infest) and to Infierno (hell), both pertinent to the happenings in the movie."
352,Infiesto,Atmospheric thriller,8,"Entertaining movie but if this was lockdown why are the main characters not wearing masks? This is a disappointing aspect of this movie especially the hospital scenes.The dubbing is unusual and slightly off putting, and possibly meant for a British audience rather than international. The landscape appears as a sepia visual possibly to denote the uncertainty of the covid lockdown anxiety.It is surreal to see no one on the roads, as the main characters piece together the mystery of the abducted girl.But it develops nicely along with the added bonus of good music to interpret the mood of the story telling."
353,Infiesto,Spanish police drama set in coronavirus,7,"As ""Infiesto"" (2023 release from Spain; 98 min) opens, we hear a TV announcement that a state of emergency has been declared due to the coronavirus. We are in ""Day 1 of the Lockdown"" and a young woman who had been missing for 3 months is found wondering the empty streets. Inspectors Garcia and Castro are ordered to find out what really happened, as each of them has personal issues as well (Garcia's mom and Castro's boyfriend are isolated due to the coronavirus). At this point we are 10 minutes in the film...Couple of comments: this is a cop drama set in the remote and rugged Asturias region in northwest Spain. No sunshine here! Just industrial, gloomy and never-ending low hanging clouds. Add on top of that dealing with the coronavirus AND investigating the mysterious disappearance of various young people, and it all leads up to a gritty police drama. I quite liked it, to be honest. I wasn't familiar with anyone of the cast or the production team. The two leads, Isak Ferriz (as Garcia) and Sandra Bullock-reminding Iria Del Rio (as Castro), mesh well together without going over the top. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about that, the better. Bottom line: this movie isn't revolutionary in any way, but it kept my attention.""Infiesto"" started streaming on Netflix in early February, and Netflix recommended it to me based on my viewing habits. Thanks Netflix! If you are in the mood for a gritty cop drama from Spain that is set just as the world comes to grips with COVID-19, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion."
354,Infiesto,I survived that. So it's not the end of my world,5,"""It's only just the beginning"" of my rants
Pros: the cast is good.. sometimes and the color scheme is good. I also learn some new stuff about celtics or spanish culture and the way they conducted the search, kinda accurate and believable.Cons: it's finna be ALOT. First of all, covid and that satanic stuff? Just unnecessary. Maybe they tryna connects it but yea, nope. Second, some scenes seriously irrelevant to the whole plot. I think they need to cut more BUT at the same time, add more? Things that relevant. There's no attachment to anything, no emotional stuff, no mystery stuff for me to be hooked. No boom stuff for me to tell home to. Plus, it's a slow burn filmOverall, it's a knockoff csi imo? It's a movie where you must have a big patience and a big ego to challenge it to the finish. It's not recommended to watch w a party."
355,Infiesto,It has it's moments,6,"(2023) Infiesta
(In Spanish with English subtitles)
THRILLERIt takes place during the year of Covid, and two homicide detectives of Samuel García (Isak Férriz) and Marta Castro(Iria Del Río) are assigned to the abduction case when a young ragged and disheveled girl reappears in the middle of the road before she is then put in a hospital. When the two detectives are coming up to see her, they apparently have their own problems at home, while Samuel is forbidden to see his mother at a care home, Marta's boyfriend has covid. By the time they got their first real lead a guy, Manuel Gomez known as ""Dog Killer"" somewhat owns a winery, only when he's found out he shoots himself."
356,Skinamarink,I really tried,5,"I went into this movie completely blind (as I try to do with most movies) and can say without question this is NOT a movie you want to go in blind. This movie is extremely experimental and abstract and will not be to most people's taste. The entire film is shot with a grainy vhs type look and is comprised of deliberately off center shots of the interior of a house. There is virtually no plot to speak of and most of the 1 hour 40 minute runtime is composed of random shots.I love films that challenge and are demanding to the viewer. I love independent cinema and slow burn films. But this film expects WAY too much from the viewer and becomes very irritating as a result. Even to the hardened art house viewer this movie expects too much. This would have made a brilliant 40 minute short as there are moments of true horror but they are surrounded by random repetitive imagery. At no point does this movie pick up pace or have any sort of narrative.This movie feels like a nightmare ASMR or a full length creepy pasta. If you suffered from night terrors or sleep paralysis or experienced childhood trauma I think you could become extremely invested in this film and that is the only way this works. I didn't feel connected or engaged in the story (I've never been through any of the above) and the only film I can compare with regards to the pacing and somnolent effect this movie had is ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"".Five points for originality."
357,Skinamarink,Could've been an amazing 30 min short film,5,"????? ?????? Don't even know what to say Some loved this movie. Some hated this movie. I fall inbetween. It's less a movie and more of an abstract art piece of different (very dark) shots and clips of things happening (or not happening) around a house where the windows and doors mysteriously vanished leaving 2 young children trapped inside with...something. It's extremely boring, nothing happens on screen, but I do have to say the jump scares got me GOOD. Some parts were very creepy and it had great atmospheric potential and I could see the vision they had, but it felt more like a grad school project with a budget of $10. It's Paranormal Activity's less formed, visually darker, weirder, younger sibling. Art is great - but when a movie relies too much on being abstract, they forget to actually create a film."
358,Skinamarink,fool me once.,1,"Do you enjoy looking at lego blocks for two hours. Ceilings, baseboards, dimly lit rooms. Then this baby is for you. Because that's all that's here. Supposedly a study in childhood fear, blah, blah ,blah, don't you be fooled by critics. This thing stinks. I was thinking that it must be some kind of joke that the film makers were pulling on me trying to make me into a jerk for watching this piece of junk. In a semi full theatre i was waiting for mass movement to the exit so i could join them. No such luck. We all sat there like morons waiting for something, anything to happen. No such luck. Hey, its your dime. Just listen to me and i'll save you the cost of the ticket. No amount of popcorn will get you thru this."
359,Skinamarink,I feel like this was my Jacob's Ladder and I'm still stuck watching it,2,"The first feature film from director and writer Kyle Edward Ball -- he's also made a proof of concept for this movie named Heck and the video for Craig Moreau's ""It Aint Nuthin'"" -- Skinamarink finds its origins in Bitesized Nightmares, a YouTube channel started by Ball that visualized nightmares contributed by commenters.Shot in the Edmonton, Alberta home that Ball grew up in for $15,000, this has all the buzz of a major debut. And that fine, as it has a definite feel for the weirdness that is within the darkness and long hallways and how terrifying it is to be a child. But then it just goes on and on, with arty shots of Lego blocks and upside down rooms and people with no faces played over cartoon soundtracks and hiss and static.There's no narrative here and the idea that keeps getting pushed -- ""Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished."" -- would not be easy to find unless you knew it going in.It's the kind of film that would wow your film school professor at ten minutes but at 100 minutes, this is the kind of movie that has one frightening thing: looking to see how much time is left throughout the film and feeling like more time keeps getting added and you must push yourself like some kind of marathon runner just to endure its endless repetitive layer images and noise-filled audio.This is a movie filled with jump cuts for people above jump cuts but who can proclaim it as cinema.This is a movie for people to feel good about themselves for liking it and being ahead of people who ""just don't get it"" (see We're All Going to the World's Fair).This is a movie where people will tweet about how it changed them and they can't shake its darkness but it's all just words like fever dream, slow burn and takes chances which are just Film Twitter words that really are sound and fury signifying nothing.Just imagine: You put a whole bunch of quiet scenes together, then turn on the lights and get loud. Of course everyone screams.Much like the worst of elevated horror, it all goes back to bad parenting. I mean, those Legos aren't going to clean themselves up. ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is a cartoon from the past which is very hit the nail on the head in this. And I really dislike the fake grain and pops added to this, like something out of that fake grindhouse trend a few years ago.The real terror within this movie is just like how Host won't stop replicating as inferior Zoom horror movies, I'll be sent so many movies next year that just stare at an old toy for an hour while someone plays an xylophone in the background and makes coffee, but shot on an old PXL2000 camera and a Casio soundtrack. Get ready for so many press releases that start with ""Influenced by Skinamarink.""I think that Ball has something in him as this movie sets up some interesting things and then never delivers on them. It's just waiting for the next scare, almost like a deconstructed horror film that's above simple scares yet uses them repeatedly. He said about this movie, ""Shooting a movie in the house you grew up in about two characters that are more or less you and your sister, I didn't have to try to make it more personal-it just sort of happened. And then an added benefit was my mom had saved a bunch of childhood toys that we used in the movie, so it got even more personal.""I'd like to see that movie, because I have no idea if any of that came into the film, so this feels more made for the artist than the audience. And then the audience wants to feel like an artist and champion it and feel superior. But it's truly a slog, a long death march where I felt like I had to finish it and make it through and when the end credits came up, it really did feel like 572 days long.I mean, if this was made with a camcorder and a $300 budget in 1984 and released on Tempe Video, I'd probably feel dfferently about it. I'd also defend this if it were directed by Bruno Mattei and stole most of its soundtrack from Phantasm.I feel like this was my Jacob's Ladder and I'm still stuck watching it.What do I know?Whenever I eat haute cuisine, I'm always starving afterward and have to stop at a gas station and get several hot dogs off the roller.You can learn more on the official site for the movie."
360,Skinamarink,Waste of time.,1,"If I would have turned this in as my final assignment back in film school I would be an accountant now.I saw a trailer for this film and it looked freaky. I liked the grainy film look and the audio was a bit haunting. Of course the trailer states that this will be the scariest movie I have ever seen... I was not expecting this to be the case but thought it may be entertaining. I was wrong.... soooooo wrong.Two minutes into this ""film"" I was bored already, but hoping that this is going somewhere. Ten minutes in I was really bored, but was hoping this would go somewhere. Thirty minutes in I was disappointed with myself that I spent the past 30 minutes watching this horrible waste of time.There are many, many other films that are way better than this mess and much more worthy of your time.I was fortunate that I saw this ""film"" at no cost, the only thing wasted was my time."
361,Skinamarink,There's an excellent short film in here,5,"But there's also over an hour of sleep-inducing dead air that does nothing to increase tension or atmosphere, at least for me. I am someone who enjoys a slow burn, but even I have my limits. I watched it at night to get into the horror atmosphere and I struggled not to fall asleep throughout the whole thing.It's a shame, because if you cut out most of that dead air there are moments of pure horror that genuinely freaked me out. Hopefully someone will do a fan edit and cut out over an hour of weird camera angles and the sound of old cartoons playing in the distance because my god there's only so much I could handle..."
362,Skinamarink,Empty,3,"I finally understood what many felt when they saw Caveat. The difference is that Caveat has plot devices, a story, a main character that demonstrates what he feels and relatable, it has disturbing images and sounds and it goes somewhere. It's also very efficient creating suspense and tension. I can't say the same about Skinamarink, which is mostly boring.Here we have a set of disconnected images that never manage to justify the existence of a long feature film, let alone its duration of almost 100 minutes. The last 5 minutes are fine. Unfortunately, by the time we get there, our minds have travelled and travelled, as it is impossible to hold on to empty space and empty content."
363,Skinamarink,I spent a week watching Skinamarink one night...,3,"Although the title of this review may appear unkind, it is nevertheless, apt.I really wanted to like this film but ended up bored and angry. Angry that the filmmaker had been so self-indulgent as to presume the audience would be able to withstand 100 minutes of this punishment.I admire what he did, the execution is excellent and I was immediately drawn into the atmosphere that the film exudes. However, as other reviewers have noted, this would have made a decent short film, maybe 20 minutes. As it stands, it overplays it's hand dramatically and had me begging to be relinquished from the monotony of the long takes which comprise the film's bloated runtime.My hope is that Shudder cuts it down significantly before it has an official on-line release. It's too bad. It really does tap into something visceral and primal."
364,Skinamarink,"It's Not Artsy, You Can Say It: It Sucked",1,"In the words of Abe Simpson: ""I've coughed up scarier stuff than that"". Skinamarink is a bland, pretentious, a film experimental only on the patience of the people who are watching it. It's all mood, no substance. It's proof you can make a film without a tripod or a light or an actual idea. I nearly fell asleep. I tried to leave early after 35 minutes of nothing happening, but ended up finishing it because the waiter didn't bring me my check until it was almost over anyhow. No, it's not just ""not for me""... it's an awfully done film who can only find an audience in people who like liking things that are anti-mainstream. It tries so little to be anything how can you love or hate it? I don't hate it... you didn't love it. I just nothing'd it. The audience I saw it with had 3 people walk out, other people saying ""I guess the face at the end was scary"". No, people, you aren't wrong... it was utter garbage with a good trailer. It was a feature film with 10 minutes of content. It sucked, that's not a controversial opinion."
365,Skinamarink,Can we watch something happy?,9,"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews?Plot is thin. Two kids wake to discover their father is gone and there are no windows or doors to the outside. Also, the toilet is missing. And there's... something... in there with them. That's about all you get. The rest is up to the four year old kid in you.Something about this film invoked a sense of dread in me that I haven't felt in 40 years. It wasn't the thing lurking in the dark that spoke to the children, though. It was the dark itself. It was the unlit corners. It was the absence of the comfort of a parent. It was the strange glow of the TV in a dark room when your unsure of your surroundings. It was that door you left open just a crack.I'm not sure what to think of this film, honestly. It's not for everyone. It may not have been for me. I'm not sure yet. But I have to hand it to the director for scaring the hell out of me."
366,Skinamarink,I have horror movie blue balls,1,"I saw this film at the recommendation of a friends husband who said he couldn't sleep because he found the film so disturbing. Luckily a theatre near me was playing it so I got my brother to join, and we're mad.First of all the grainy film texture made me motion sick, second of all none of the scares paid off. It was like good set up and just nothing.It was also too dark, you couldn't see anything.Too quiet and too loud. All the dialogue is whispered and only sometimes captioned so I couldn't make out what characters where saying half the time.And omg was it too long. I think we thought it ended at least 8 times and just groaned when the movie kept going."
367,Skinamarink,Worst Film of the Year.,1,"Now, I know that this movie technically released in 2022, but didn't come to theaters until 2023. In the second week of January, Skinamarink hits theaters, and is the worst movie of 2023.It played on Friday the 13th, no less. In the same theater I saw this, Friday the 13th part 6 was playing 2 hours later. Figuring that F13 was a later movie, and I'd seen it numerous times, why not check out a new movie?I figured wrong.This is definitely the worst movie I've sat through in my entire life...and that's even after sitting through Pet Sematary 2019, and Halloween Ends.This movie was filmed like a child was trying out his dad's camcorder and didn't properly know how to use it. As if he held the camera in one place, and moved his head instead of the camera, thinking he was recording what his own eyes see.There was no storyline. There was no acting. There were barely any faces. There were about 5 unnecessary jump scares, as in, nothing at all was happening when there was just a jump scare for the sake of calling it a horror movie.I don't think I ever walked out at the end of a movie where the audience was in complete silence trying to have this abomination that passes as cinema sink in. I also don't think I finished a movie and had been as angry as I was to have wasted my time actually going to a theater in hopes of actually seeing a scary movie.Just watch the trailer over and over and it will basically have the same effect as the actual movie. The trailer, though intriguing, and leaves you with a desire to see it just to know what it's about, is exactly what the movie's about...nothing."
368,Skinamarink,A chilling finale did not make up for the boring events leading up to it,4,"All the people saying this film is plotless are wrong. There is a plot here, although it is extemely vague and thin. Might be one of the thinnest plotlines I've ever seen and that is what caused the film to be at times unbearably boring for me. I actually enjoyed the aesthetic for the film, the faceless characters, the low light, lofi camera work. It's a style that could present a high creep factor with the proper story to go along with it. This is not that story.I will say this is much better than the director's previous effort 'Heck', which is basically the short film that started this one. It feels like the director has a better grip on the style he's presenting here. That still doesn't make up for the lack of story here.The film opens with one of the children falling down the stairs and this starts the chain of events that make me believe the child actually died when this happened and he is living in some purgatory or hell. What follows after this could only be described as mean spirited and harsh, but it unfolds so slowly that you feel like you're just watching paint dry. There are some suitably creepy moments but they are few and far between. Actually there is maybe about 3 or 4 creepy scenes in the entire film, the ending being far and wide the most uncomfortable. Had me looking over my shoulder as I was leaving the theater.(I had the whole theater to myself, I'm assuming due to bad weather, but it was probably the best way to watch this film as isolation is a major theme.) The ending felt like I was being personally talked to by the faceless, out of focus boy and I hated it, but in a good way.All in all, I still couldn't call this a good movie and it will only appeal to a very niche horror crowd. I commend the director for creating something so different. I just wish there was as much thought put into the story as there was in the shooting style.2 portals out of 5."
369,Skinamarink,"Skinamarinl, Norweigian for Boring AF.",1,"The people that praise this movie are either the people who made this trash or high. This movies was over an hour of bad camera shots of the walls, ceiling, table lamps, and floor.It's like a couple kids tried to do a Blair Witch style movie and forgot to make it scary.I cannot fathom how people found this scary. Seeing Grandma naked is way more scary than this snore fest.I read the reviews first, then watched and waited, with baited breath, for something scary. Like hoping to win the mega ball or that million dollar scratch ticket, I was sorely disappointed. If you find this scary, sleep with the lights on, don't go outside, ever, and never, ever interact with another human being. I've been more scared of Pokeman cartoons than this movie. Seriously, the scariest part were the legos on the floor, because stepping on those are horrible. This is not a horror movie, it's just horrible."
370,Skinamarink,Too minimalist but what do you expect for 15k,5,"I did not dislike this movie. It was more or less exactly what I expected. As a fan of the creepy aesthetic of David Lynch and movies that challenge the audience I wasn't too disappointed. I love the concept and appreciate the approach but ultimately if you are going to ask an audience for 90-120 minutes of their time I think a film should give them more than Skinamarink delivers. Still, from a first time filmmaker it's an admirable effort.I far prefer slow burning horror films that play to the fear of the unknown and an have an underlying sense of dread (The Witch, Hereditary, and The Blair Witch Project are personal faves). Skinamarink tries to play in this arena but doesn't effectively use any cinematic tools to build tension or make the viewer anxious. No soundtrack, very little camera movement, and not enough dynamic use of light and shadow. All things that I think probably could have been achieved, even with a miniscule budget. Thematically it starts in a very minable vein but then doesn't actually develop what amounts to a fairly universal experience of fear (i.e. Being a defenseless child abandoned by caregivers). We feel isolated and alone with the children but are distanced from the sense that anything frightening is happening I think because so little of the film takes place from the children's perspective. It did get me thinking about how to make a horror movie driven by fear of the unknown. If you want to make something universally scary how much do you need to show the audience to prime them to be afraid and how much can you leave to their imaginations? In the end Skinamarink asks the individual viewer to fill in too many blanks for it to be an effective horror movie in my opinion. Truly neurotic people will probably find it unnerving and anxiety inducing but aside from a couple of cheap jump scares nothing particularly interesting happens. My impression was that the vast majority of people will most likely find the movie a waste of time and for that reason I cannot recommend it. But if you like a challenge, are home alone on a stormy night, and/or are capable of letting your imagination run wild then, sure, give it a shot."
371,Skinamarink,"The worst ""movie"" of 2022, and one of the worst films I've ever seen.",1,"Let me try to break this down for you;1. Do you like weird camera angles that focus on the tops of doorways and only show people from their ankles down?2. Do you like movies that are so dark, you can barely tell what's going on?3. Do you like movies where people whisper, so you absolutely need to watch the movie with subtitles?4. Do you like jump scares that are ruined because they're too dark to see?5. Do you like movies where the story takes a back seat to experimental nonsense?If you shook your head no to any of the questions above, guess what? You will absolutely hate this movie like I did. Never in my life have I see a movie that was equal parts annoying as it was mundane. I fell asleep watching it not once, not twice, but 5 whole times, and for a movie like this with a runtime of almost 2 hours, you'll understand why it was so many. This wasn't a movie in the pure sense of the word. This was the type of movie shown for free and labeled as ""transgressive art"" in a modern art museum. It wasn't entertaining, it was horribly and cheaply made, and will only leave a lasting impression on children and those with child-like IQ's.I should have know this was going to be trash because TIkTok couldn't stop talking about it. The people on that app have the absolutely worst taste on everything, and this movie was the absolute bottom of the barrel. I will never get my 2 hours back, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let anyone else make the same mistake.DO NOT WATCH THIS ""MOVIE"". Its terrible in every conceivable way."
372,Skinamarink,WTF?,2,"My hometown isn't exactly known for great movies being produced there, nevermind having great film-makers, so I was hoping that this film would at least break that curse due to the traction that it has been getting.I must also add some positives here and add congrats to the film-maker for completing their project. Making a movie is no small task, on any budget.Sadly that's where the positives begin and end. I've never in my life seen something so boring, I think I've enjoyed watching paint dry more. The shots are lifeless, the sound is horrendous, and my god what in the heck was that final shot?This is a new low in filmmaking. It had nothing redeeming about it, even the most bad films have something you can get out of it but this is just some half assed b.s. Labelled as artsy.If someone could break the curse of terrible filmmaking from my city that would be great, unfortunately that is not the case with Skinamarink.Stay away, stay far away!"
373,Skinamarink,"I get why some find it boring,",9,"But I did not.Yes, Kyle Edward Ball's audaciously odd directorial debut is about 25-30 minutes too long, edited in such a way that too many shots overstay their welcome.Yes, it is filmed in a manner to seemingly intentionally test an audience's patience with still shots that hide the characters' faces and set aside narrative momentum in favor of metaphorical experimentation.This will bother, and clearly has bothered, a lot of people. And I get it. It's not what they wanted. No hard feelings to these people. But now I want to talk about why I loved this film.I was absolutely gripped by Skinamarink. I found so much depth and meaning to come from its bare-bones visual and aural presentation.It's so, so ambiguous. But that didn't bother me because rather than showing bizarre imagery for the sake of it like so many experimental films, Ball instead keeps a GREAT deal of unknown in each frame.The creaky, eerie sound complimented the ever-shifting static of the cinematography to make my brain play all kinds of tricks on me. A handful of horrifying disturbing images make an appearance throughout the film, but the constant wondering of ""what was that sound"" or ""did I see something move in the frame"" made me just as on edge throughout.Though short on plot, I still found surprising thematic/character depth in each of the movie's unsettling, eerie frames of a single house.We don't get to know much about Kevin and Kaylee, but we know what kind of relationship they have as young siblings from the film's opening scenes, and it is so soul-crushing to see what happens and doesn't happen to them over the story's nightmarish happenings.As these kids are stalked in their house by something unknown and unseen, the horrifying things we see and hear are so clearly indicative of common childhood fears, traumas, and challenges: divorce, nightmares, abandonment, neglect, death, and a lack of control over your own choices.Seeing them play out on screen in such an uncanny way was so sad and so terrifying. The film's lack of a musical score, lack of concrete answers, piercing sound design, and ability to turn the intimacies of childhood into faceless, unknowable antagonists all made this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen."
374,Skinamarink,The Rebirth of Primal Childhood Fears - A Reward for the Patient,7,"""Skinamarink"" is undoubtedly one of the most unique viewing experiences in my existing memory, and it's rather challenging for me to truly pinpoint my own reaction and opinion of it. Depending on your taste, it can be equal parts a liminal horror masterpiece and a true tedium. I know one thing to be true, it requires absolute attention and maximum immersion to get out of it all that director Kyle Edward Ball intended to do to you.Two little children, 5 year old Kaylee and her 4 years old brother Kevin, wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. Definitely sounds like a concept to bring a lot of creeps. And so it does. ""Skinamarink"" starts out with the slowest pacing I've ever experienced, and during the first 20-30 minutes one might feel the temptation to give up on this film. The entire cinematography, the sum of the 100 minute runtime consists almost exclusively of obscure shots of just about everything in the (director's childhood) house, except people. You practically don't see character's faces at all, only legs. Ceiling. Walls. Furniture. Darkness, a lot of darkness, holding within itself the dreadful sense than anything can come into your eyes and mind at any given time. The screen is full of grain and 70's-like screen scratches, the depthless dark keeps morphing, and the sense of dread is creeping-crawling around every corner of every frame. You know that weird, scary pile of clothes in your room in the middle of the night? This is that: the movie. It's an absolute trump move to put such youngins as main characters, the rebirth of your most primal childhood fears is what Kyle Edward Ball wants to offer you. Most people seek the kind of comfort an ignorant bliss they had as young children, but director of ""Skinamarink"" serves just the opposite of that spectrum.It's a liminal, esoteric, ambient, analogue, lo-fi horror if I've ever seen one. And made with palpable, impressive confidence. Slowly, very slowly, but surely, ""Skinamarink"" lulls one into the deep sense of unease, hiding short, momentary glimpses of absolute terror inbetween long periods of almost sheer ambient nothingness. It's a movie that rewards the patient. Ball gives us a playground in which our imagination will do more work than the movie itself, and that's not a negative critique, but quite the feat.""Skinamarink"" creates a tiny yet massive world, from which there is no escape. Days after seeing it, I'm still trying to grasp what I saw, and on what scale I enjoyed it. This film has gotten the kind of buzz no art can buy, and rightly so, I believe it will be remembered as cult film, perhaps even as a revolutionary kind of horror. My rating: 7/10."
375,Skinamarink,"I wanted to like it, I really did.",6,"I'm pretty sure I understand what the director is trying to do, and believe it or not, I respect him for it. A lot of the time, I was, indeed, thinking of my childhood nightmares and irrational fears, like many others have said they did. But it didn't scare me. Despite all the hype on Reddit and going in without expectations, it just didn't do much of anything for me.I think it's partly because I KNOW those fears are irrational and I just can't put myself in the mindset of my inner child anymore, not to mention I'm well-attuned to the dark side of things, so it doesn't feel as threatening now. Another reason is because the ""scary"" moments in the movie are relegated to a few small jumpscares, and some moments where you THINK something bad is about to happen, but without the payoff. Lastly, I don't think the ultra-minimalistic approach is for me. While the unknown can definitely be scary when done right, I require identifiable traits to characters beyond just voices and footsteps to feel anything for them.There's definitely parts that made me slightly unnerved, such as the disembodied voice - an entity or possibly the darkness itself - instructing one of the children to put a knife in their eye, with the sound of a child crying shortly afterwards. Unfortunately, the movie's too long for its own good. I watched it pretty late at night when I was tired and winding down, so that might have had something to do with me being less than impressed.Like I said, I respect the director's effort. He's clearly trying to make minimalism scary, and assuming that he's not astroturfing it (I will say I'm a little suspicious that the movie started out with something over 4 stars only to get a 5.5 in like a week after I last checked), he seems to have succeeded with at least a few, and I genuinely admire that. I just don't think his style is for me. I checked out some of his short films, including Heck, which is sort of a prototype for Skinamarink, but didn't feel any actual dread. I still feel bad about checking it out early instead of waiting for a mass release in the US, so I'm willing to give it another try so that Kyle at least gets his money's worth from me watching it."
376,Skinamarink,This would of been better as a 15 min short,3,"At first I was enjoying this movie. I expected it to be scary. It wasn't really and eventually it got boring. Just when I had my fill there was still like way to much of the movie left. It has no business being this long. Most of the scenes in this film are highly irrelevant. They're just filler for atmosphere. Although the atmosphere presented was intense it over stayed its welcome. I don't regret watching this movie but I would not recommend it and will never watch it again. It did however make me feel like the concept might be nice to see if better executed in a shorter movie. If you chose to watch this movie. Just know the entire movie is just how the beginning is. You never really see any actors at all. Just empty rooms with voices. Specifically the children in question. It does not flesh out into anything bigger at all. If you do not feel the movie 30 minutes in, don't expect it to change. It will not."
377,Skinamarink,House Of Leaves.,6,"I just watched it, and I dug it. In many respects it reminded of the book House Of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. A book that has a similar theme of a house that has rooms that constantly change, people disappear etc. And as someone that has grown up watching experimental films, as well as listening to and making experimental music, I thought the pace of the film was just right.The power of suggestion is always a good thing, and the fact that there was little footage of actual people present here works well. It added to the sense of isolation in the house. The whispering too was a nice touch. The children sensed there was something there.I also found the atmosphere throughout kind of relaxing. Maybe I'm just used now, to dark things."
378,Skinamarink,"All Style, No Substance or Scares",2,"If you like looking at boring shots of the tops of doorways, T. V. screens, and kids toys for 100 minutes, this movie is for you! It's incredibly dull. It also ends in a very unsatisfying conclusion. Now, I don't mind ambiguous endings at all, but after the long, bloated time it took to get there, it was not worth it. Only reason I gave this more than one star was because there is a very effective scene involving one of the children in his parents' room, but that's about it. I feel like the director is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what would stick (wink, wink). Go watch the trailer and imagine watching it over and over again for over an hour and a half. That's the movie."
379,Skinamarink,Could've been better,5,"A nice and fresh take in the scene. Pretty unique.But I started to lose interest in about 10 minutes in.Don't get me wrong... the style is absolutely unsettling and omnious. But it's the same style throughout and that what's getting bored.Still shots that go on for too long, some inaudible voices, grainy scènes...all done in a good way, but it gets pretty boring. Too bad..
I really hoped this one got a new, fresh take on the genre. But it lacks. It keeps repeating itself until it gets boring or repetitive.I think the so called hype is only for the style of this new movie. But as mentioned, it's nothing more than that.It could've been better imo..."
380,Skinamarink,"Believe me, the emperor has no clothes here...",1,"I lasted a little less than an hour before I couldn't take any more of this complete travesty of a cow pie and turned it off. There are ads currently hyping this film to prepare it for a theatrical release (and if this can find a distributor, anything can), and once audiences realize they've been totally had, it will die the quiet death it deserves. Basically the ""plot"" consists of watching two kids monotonously crawl around an empty house in the dark, with the same group of point-of-view shots endlessly repeated over and over again. There is nothing ""creepy"" or ""horrifying"" about it whatsoever... it's just appallingly empty and pretentious. The film has a running time of 100 minutes, but it appears the filmmaker shot only about 15 or 20 of actual footage and just repeated most of the same shots over and over again during the editing process, ad nauseum. I'm a huge fan of independent and experimental horror films, but this load of excrement doesn't even come close to even fitting that genre, it just insults the intelligence. The reviews here claiming it's frightening have got to be either planted, or if they're not, written by people who must have a scare quotient of -10. The film has been making the rounds on the internet for some time now, and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it - it's seriously not worth the admission price of a dollar. The budget was reportedly $15,000.00... it seriously looks like it was made for less than $25.00. You've been warned."
381,Magic Mke,It's not about the stripping...,8,"This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, but—as Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, ""That's what I do—it's not who I am."" Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term ""self-actualization"" in a review of ""Magic Mike""; I told you you might be shocked.At any rate, plenty of folks (like the pathetic woman who was sitting behind me in the theater, the one who clapped like a poorly trained seal, guffawed, and cackled any time the least bit of male skin appeared on screen) will go see this movie because of all the hype about the hot male bodies in various states of undress—and they will certainly enjoy the film on that very basic level. But let's be honest here, folks—this is a Stephen Soderbergh film—and Soderbergh does not use sex and titillation gratuitously. The plot is compelling, the film is well written and masterfully directed, and Channing Tatum proves that he is much, much more than a hot body and a pretty face. For his sake, here's hoping that ""Magic Mike"" can propel him along a career path similar to those of other handsome actors who managed to overcome ""Movie Star"" looks to prove that they were genuine actors. Like Brad Pitt."
382,Magic Mke,Aside from the stripping there's nothing new here but I was never bored,7,"This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.First let's get the nude issue out of the way. There is only one full frontal in the movie--it's off to the side, is partially blocked and is probably faked. It's also very funny. There's mostly butt shots only but all are from Tatum, Pettyfer and Adam Rodriguez. This movie is NOT about the nudity. The movie moves slow (although I was never bored) and main events happen off screen OR are never explained! Still the movie works. For one thing all the acting is good. I was surprised at how good Tatum was. I never thought he could act till this. He captures his character perfectly. Pettyfer was equally good as Adam. Even Matthew McConaughey was good as the group's owner named Dallas. The strip acts themselves are incredible. All the guys are in good shape and Tatum shows some moves that are jaw-dropping! However they're not shot in an exploitive fashion. They're done in a matter of fact way that actually makes them seem quite funny. This movie (script wise) shows us nothing new but it was well-made and entertaining. This is not just for women and gay men--I think everyone would enjoy it. I give it a 7."
383,Magic Mke,"The law says you cannot touch, but I think I see a lotta lawbreakers up in this house tonight...",9,"Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a ""male stripper movie,"" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a ""gay cowboy movie."" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, ""Worst movie ever."" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, ""Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?"" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.The cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never really liked in the films he starred in before, but he is just phenomenal in this film. Horn, on the other hand, seemed to come out from nowhere, but her rapport with Tatum is terrific. Let's also not forget about Matthew McConaughey. Even though he isn't in the film that much, he steals every single scene he's in. He's just that good.MAGIC MIKE will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to ""a movie for the ladies."" MAGIC MIKE is funny and dramatic when it needs to be, but the main reason it succeeds is because of the cast. Overall, MAGIC MIKE is a very good film. Just don't expect a lot of stripping."
384,Magic Mke,I'm one of very few that loves this movie!,10,"Everything about this to me is well directed with great dialogue, smooth scenes and the soundtrack is gold! Steven Soderbergh was perfect for this with the films he's done you can't go wrong. I'm not fully sure what the negativity stemmed from I think Magic Mike is great all around for both genders too. Ever since the movie came on HBO I've seen so many times cause I enjoy most the scenes and I love the song Victim by Win Win that song is brilliant. I'm probably peculiar for being a guy that loves the movie and I disagree with the person that said something about not enough energy that's way wrong."
385,Magic Mke,"Very Slow Comedy, but brings in Great Laughs and Performances,",7,"Magic Mike is a good movie with a well developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's an enjoyable movie that brings in many laughs, as well as terrific performances from the entire cast, the chemistry between everyone is great, particularly the parts between Channing Tatum and Cody Horn, they both seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company and their scenes were very natural. It's a really slow movie and can admittedly get very boring at times, there are a lot of very lengthy scenes were the characters are literally just talking, while they are well acted and serve as a great method for character development, they can still get very tedious, they could have easily trimmed a lot of scenes and made it a more bearable ninety minute run. The highlight of the movie is definitely Matthew McConaughey, playing a character unlike one he has ever played before, he is very natural and charismatic in the role of Dallas, his scenes certainly had me entertained the most. It may be very slow, but Magic Milke is still an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, easy to watch, comedy if you ever see it on television and had some time to kill. A male stripper teaches a newcomer how to handle the lifestyle, while a relationship develops between him and the newcomers sister. Best Performance: Matthew McConaughey"
386,Magic Mke,"Trailer is misleading, great movie though",8,"The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.Soderbergh crafts a powerful but almost self-defeating film that I doubt will be a huge popularity winner due to its unconventional story. (Sidenote: why is it that filmmakers can make critically-acclaimed masterpieces about female strippers/prostitutes, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but if the g-string is on the other gender it's just goofy fun?) Due to its deceptive marketing, ""Magic Mike"" is passed off as crowd-pleasing entertainment, but it's really a very sobering look at life with more introspective moments than laughs.Channing Tatum plays Mike, a guy with the bod of a Greek god, probably not very educated but with a very smart, creative ambition: to build artistic furniture. Somehow, instead, he ends up thrusting his pelvis on stage for screaming ladies. Enter Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year-old kid who, like many 19-year-olds, doesn't have a clue. Mike takes Adam under his wing and introduces him to the night life, all the while promising Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that he'll take care of Adam.If you can see where this is going, then great. That's the point. ""Magic Mike"" does something that few films have the guts to do. It sets up a predictable situation and then takes us through exactly that. No wacky, contrived plot twists necessary. Instead it focuses on how different people react and change when confronted with a predictable set of events.Another thing this film does, better than any other I've seen in recent memory, is that it gives us REAL dialogue. I'm talking about the scenes between Mike & Brooke. It's every bit as real as something you'd experience in real life, right down to the stammering, the awkward fidgeting, the ""flubbed lines"". I put that in quotations because I'm not sure if the script was written that way, or if Tatum actually flubbed a few lines and Soderbergh left them in. My point is that the dialogue & chemistry between those two is so believable you'd think they didn't have a camera on them.""Magic Mike"" is not for everyone. It can't be accurately summed up with some exuberant catchphrase like ""Laugh out loud funny!"" or ""A tragic masterpiece!"" or ""Nail biting suspense!"" Also I would say that this is a very uncomfortable date movie, a very uncomfortable bro movie, and it's probably too heavy for a fun, gal's night out movie. If you do see it, it's probably best watched alone so you can really soak in the personal story it's telling. On an individual level I think we can all relate to the idea of being sidetracked by the pursuit of a dream, rather than the dream itself, regardless of if we're guys wearing buttless cowboy pants in front of 200 squealing, undersexed women."
387,Magic Mke,No magic here.,1,"A good poster, and an effective trailer, make excellent marketing tools for a truly awful movie.Anything good is in the trailer. The only scenes that are the slightest bit interesting are on stage in the club. The rest of the time it's actors spouting bad dialogue with little or nothing to do. Classic lines like ""Hey"" and ""Hey do you want to get something to eat?"". They walk and talk. They sit and talk. They drink and talk. They stare toward the right or left or look at the ocean like it's supposed to mean something.Some of the original music is interesting and fits. The film has a golden tone appearance to the scenes outside of the club which becomes distracting and adds nothing. There's a scene after the sorority fight scene that seems out of place before the confrontation in the club. There is no reason to like the thinly drawn characters, and even less reason to like the movie. It's too long, often boring and feels like it is yet to be written. Steven Soderbergh is tied for the most overrated director of this generation.Don't waste your time, money, or eyes on this one."
388,Magic Mke,"Schizophrenic: Why ""Magic Mike"" doesn't work",4,"As I watched ""Magic Mike"", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.And then it ended.I was confused. So many things didn't make sense. So many questions were left unanswered. Where was the conflict's resolution? What happened to Adam? When did Mike and Brooke fall in love? What was with Tarzan's character? Did I have the wrong mindset? The problem with ""Magic Mike"" is that it attempts to appeal to every form of movie watcher and, instead, appeals only to the ladies fanning themselves while mesmerized by abs and biceps. While Mike (a surprisingly decent Channing Tatum) is an interesting character, the movie's structure and story suffer from Steven Soderbergh's direction.1. ""Magic Mike"" has no goal. No themes, no morals, no bottom-line. We see hints of anti-drug sentimentality, and Soderbergh draws a little attention to the effects of the male stripper world on the male mind. But these elements are only hints, and are abandoned by the time the credits roll. Mike doesn't regret his actions as a stripper, only that he continued to be one into his 30's. He dabbles in drugs in one (hyper-extended and annoying) montage-esque scene, but that event too has few direct consequences.All this would be okay if the movie was a comedy. However...2. ""Magic Mike"" isn't funny. Not by any stretch of the imagination. We have some witty remarks that are bound to induce some smiles, but the only laughs come from people's ""shock"" from the dance numbers. There are no jokes, no slapstick humor, and the dance numbers really aren't that amusing (to a male). The only truly funny scene is when Adam (a bored looking Alex Pettyfer) is first backstage with Tarzan and the other strippers.If this movie lacks a drama's thematic elements and a comedy's laughs, then it must be a romance, right?3. ""Magic Mike"" isn't romantic. In fact, Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) don't let any sparks fly at all. A relationship between the two isn't even a possibility until they get into their first shouting match, near (what I assume to be) the movie's climax. Their relationship is never given time to grow because the movie's first half tries to build a story around Adam and Mike's relationship. However, the second half drops Adam almost completely and attempts to bring in Brooke. Both relationships fall flat, not to mention Adam ends up as a terrible human being.In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies because Soderbergh shoots high and misses everything. Also, ""Magic Mike"" is peppered with extended ""erotic"" dance numbers that add nothing to the plot and exist purely to satisfy the target audience: middle-aged women. These scenes, in addition to the movie's schizophrenic lack of direction, will disappoint any movie lover's hopes of seeing a film that provides insight into the mind of a male stripper.At least, the audience could have used a decent ending."
389,Magic Mke,Way more magic involved than I had presumed,9,"It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same ""the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie"". I couldn't disagree more.I went into the movie with basically no expectations. In my opinion, Soderbergh is completely hit or miss. He has classics like Sex, Lies, and Videotape and stinkers like The Girlfriend Experience. This is the only movie of his aside from Sex, Lies, and Videotape that I have truly loved through and through.I don't know what people are talking about criticizing the acting. This is one of the best roles I have seen Tatum pull. Matthew McConaughy is perfect as the head slime ball. The lead who plays ""The Kid"" or Adam is a completely believable representation of every guy who is in his shoes in the world. And the sister Brooke, while coming off as a little obnoxious with her grim stares around the beginning of the movie, had a tough role to play but she did it with flying colors as well - by the end of the film she becomes a quite endearing figure.The soundtrack was good. The camera work and editing was innovative. There were some really cool montage-esque segments towards the middle of the movie that actually worked really well and were pretty stylish. The cinematography during the dance sequences are especially vibing and impressive as well.People complain there is no plot or ending - I think these people must be lacking depth or lacking a brain in general. From the very start, the movie flowed very well, a slow and smooth grind into the world that we will end up spending the rest of it's length existing in. The movie maintains an impressive realism through the majority of it's scenes - instead of trying to feel like a blockbuster feature, it feels like what it would feel like in reality. The focus of the plot changes slightly throughout the film, but stays open and interesting. And the ending, I don't think could have been more perfect - if you take nothing from it, well, you must be missing a lot of things in life.I dunno what else to say! This is absolutely one of my favorite Soderbergh movies and easily one of the best movies I have seen this year in 2012 so far. I recommend it to anyone with brains."
390,Magic Mke,"Great buns, shame about the script",7,"So many elements that could have made this a truly original movie. Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all, entertaining and little, very little else."
391,Magic Mke,Not the way real dancers are.,4,"I was a stripper. Yes, I was. I was fairly good too.This film however doesn't capture the reality behind the stage, on-stage or even the crowd.The reality is that the male dancers - or even female dancers aren't all friends...they are greedy, selfish ego tripping characters who look forward only to the dollars. They fight backstage, they get drunk back stage and they do serious amounts of coke back stage.Most male dancers are also gay. I am not and for that reason, the few men that are not gay will be reading ""picture books"" behind the curtain to ensure that they are ""up"" to the challenge when they are on stage.The gay men will be taking care of each other respectively before they go on stage.Most female crowds are mostly fat, overweight women who are nearing 50 and are there to get totally drunk. Male dancers will go to the table for them and pull everything off, but will not take them on-stage and perform nasty acts - clothed or unclothed.Also - we didn't have groups of 5 or 6 go up on-stage and perform a routine set. With people travelling all the time and new people coming in and out, we barely knew who each other was from a daily basis.Nobody fraternized with the bar-staff after closing...everybody was tired, stressed or too stoned to do anything. The bar-staff closed up and everybody got kicked out.If anybody tried to do a back-flip on-stage, they would have been fired or told not to do that again...because of liability and safety and insurance reasons.We made our money doing lap dances...not having a hundred girls throw money in our underwear on-stage.The back room dressing areas were always slightly better than a warehouse - filled with all sorts of bar crap...regardless of the bar or location.Anybody under the legal limit would never be allowed on-stage. There was always vice to make sure.There was always so much tension in the dressing room...because we were competing for the same money, that more than the mere basic communication between dancers never existed.This is a film based on the male stripper occupation, but misses out on the reality of it.It's also over drawn for plot. So much could be edited out and would not make a difference to the story.I was looking forward to see this, and I finally did. Wow...too long to watch a movie to see next to nothing of interest."
392,Magic Mke,Check your preconceptions at the door,8,"There is a real film here, contrary to many biased reviewers. A well-told story and assured direction push Magic Mike beyond the stigma it has received. Channing Tatum is a good actor and I won't hear anything to the contrary. He has a real knack for acting casually cool in his roles and his dancing is genuinely impressive. McConaughey also gives a tremendous performance and fully commits to the role. If you're willing to look past the premise, you can find an actually enjoyable film here."
393,Magic Mke,"Too Long, Boring, and Didn't Have a Real Ending....",3,"I am going to make my review short, sweet, and to the point. Something Magic Mike was not. As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next... NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY... but one of the main characters in the movie has a HUGE LIFE ISSUE, and they NEVER SOLVE IT, they give you nothing... just ""WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, THE END"""
394,Magic Mke,A Young Man's game,7,"Unless you are going to go into the business end of it like Matthew McConaughey does male stripping is definitely for those just entering legal majority and a bit beyond. You get old mighty quick in the game as Channing Tatum in the title role realizes. He's got a day job and he's saving his money to start a business.On that day job is Alex Pettyfer who hasn't got it as together as Tatum does. So when Tatum brings him into the male strip club to work for McConaughey, young Pettyfer becomes an instant star. His sister Cody Horn is concerned for him because he's also a bit of screw-up. She hopes that Tatum will keep him somewhat in line. She kind of likes Tatum herself.A person I know who is in this line tells me Magic Mike was better than he thought it would be. Both of us were prepared for something truly trashy and Magic Mike wasn't that at all. The characters were both real and engaging though if you want to see some erotic male dancing than this is a movie that will provide.I'd check this out, but don't bring the kiddies."
395,Magic Mke,The lifestyle of male strippers with characters and dichotomies,7,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims ""I was hoping it was all a joke."" I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, ""No, but it is pretty funny."" He's also right.""Magic Mike"" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.Shortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.Also as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the ""proper"" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.I am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it."
396,Magic Mke,Magic Mike: Needed More Magic and Less Mike,3,"Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants ""something more"" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.I won't spoiler the actual film but here's what its about: Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a construction worker by day and male stripper by night. He meets pretty boy Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn) at work and gets Adam a stripping job at the strip joint owned by Dallas (""I see a lot of law breakers""...must a say HIS name?). Romantic fireworks explode between characters and Adam gets into trouble along the way.Here's how I'm going to analyze: Story: All I can about the story is that it is your typical romantic 21st century Hollywood film. You can predict the whole movie and ending very easily.Characters: These characters were walking cardboards. Mike, Adam, Brooke, Joanna, Norah, even Tarzan, etc HAD NO PERSONALITY! The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies). I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times.Acting: I hated to judge this part because there isn't much to judge. The acting is...mediocre at best. Channing Tatum plays the role he plays in every film of his: the good guy with little personality. I feel Tatum CAN really act but he needs to expand his range like Johnny Depp does or Heath Ledger use to. Adam Pettyfer has tried to expand his range (like in ""Beastly"")but the kid, as good looking as he is, just can't act. Cody Horn was the weakest link. She'll probably be the next Julia Stiles, meaning she'll be cast in the same role in every film (good films probably) next to good looking guys even though she can't act.These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. The only song in the film I could remember was ""Its Raining Men"". The directing had some shaky camera. I remember that. The visuals were...okay. If you like naked men.Overall, the film was...""eh"". I was bored through most of it and I left the theater with no intentions to ever see it again. I gave the film three stars out of ten. The film needed more ""magic"" in storytelling and originality then ""Mike"" just being your typical Hollywood dream guy that doesn't really exist."
397,Magic Mke,One for the ladies (and gentlemen),6,"The usherette tittered when I bought my ticket. 'Why do you laugh?' I asked. 'Because only girls are watching this'. Clearly this is someone who doesn't believe in the universality of cinema. Yes, Steven Soderbergh's latest features male strippers, and yes it will appeal more to a certain demographic, but so will every film. Audiences may be disparate but films are androgynous. Or should be. As 'Magic' Mike, charming Channing Tatum naturally gets top billing, but the film revolves around Adam (rising star Alex Pettyfer). Adam is a congenital loser, the kind of guy who refuses to wear a tie and wonders why he can't sustain a job. He lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), whose acting conveys a suspicion of men, presumably because she has only her wayward brother as a yardstick. Adam finds work on a construction site with Mike, who sees the desperation of Adam's situation and entices him to join his exotic dancing troupe, Xquisite, led by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Dallas astutely exploits Adam's naivety by branding him 'The Kid', an amateurish, sloppy act, which the ladies love. The next three months are a non-stop orgy of girls, booze and drugs: everything a man like Adam could wish for. This lifestyle has lost its appeal for Mike, now 30, who only took up professional undressing to become a bespoke furniture salesman. He no longer wishes to hold out for the phantom 10% of the business Dallas keeps promising him, but poor credit keeps him on the pole. (Tatum again stars in a role which brings out his effortless charisma and sweetness.)McConaughey recently impressed me in William Friedkin's 'Killer Joe', and now this film has completely changed my mind about him. He's gone from my dud to my stud list in just two films. And Pettyfer works because he doesn't work, if you see what I mean. Although an ex-model, he's not 'stripper material' (not that I'd know much about that sort of thing), yet there's a naturalness to his acting, which works. Although not in the same league as some of Soderbergh's other titles (notably 'Traffic' and 'Out of Sight'), there's enough going on to warrant a viewing. Characters are well written, lives intersect in an unforced manner, motivations are believable. There's plenty of saucy (and quite impressive) dancing to keep the majority of this film's audience happy, but there's also a decent story for those who aren't watching exclusively for nudity. www.moseleyb13.com"
398,Magic Mke,Too much of one's ego and no director on sight to take hold on it:(,4,"Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking ""You can't just get enough of pretty naked men"". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of ""Let's make a good film"" attitude rather than purely ""Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club""... It made me sad - I was counting on something that would be a start of amazing acting careers for Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and Alex Pettyfer. Well, in my opinion this film won't help. Period."
399,Magic Mke,"Grateful surprise, grateful...",8,"So, wow, what a delight, I didn't like the second, I thought the first would be even worse, but what a pleasant surprise, folks, the story was very simple, but cute and captivating, captivating was also Channing Tatum, deliciously tasty, I wanted to taste it, even McConaughey was hot, Alex Pettyfer is not to be thrown away... Grateful surprise, grateful..."
400,Magic Mke,"More Magic, Mike, More Magic",6,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"" is short on needed magic. The promised backstage tale of male strippers conjures images of sexy men, pulsating music, and erotic choreography. Unfortunately, the expected companion piece to ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" is not even ""The Full Monty."" Magic Mike, competently played by Channing Tatum, is a construction worker by day, a stripper by night, and a furniture designer by ambition. A fellow hard hat on the construction site, Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer, is drawn into Mike's stripper world by the lure of easy money and even easier sex. Little unexpected happens, and the audience for naked male flesh and sexual couplings is better served at the local porn shop.The dialog is lame and often delivered listlessly. Perhaps strippers and their friends are low-key characters and talk like Mike and his friends, but eyes glaze and brains go numb after nearly two hours spent in their company. A physically fit Matthew McConaughey looks almost cadaverous as Dallas, the strippers' tough manager. However, McConaughey is effective, and his scenes resuscitate the film when he is on screen, which is all too briefly. Despite his age, McConaughey has the vulgar moves, the erotic gyrations, and the sexual aura that the other supposed strippers lack.""Magic Mike"" drags on and seems longer than it is. Soderbergh inserts a few arty shots, but generally fails to even capture the excitement of a ""Flashdance,"" a glossy construction-worker-cum-dancer feature-length music video that moved to a beat and never bored. The music herein is forgettable at best, and the dancing owes more to Las Vegas posturing than Broadway or discotheques. Perhaps Soderbergh was the wrong director for the project, which was an odd choice for the man who made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" Magic Mike's story is unexpectedly downbeat, and the angst of a frustrated furniture designer is low on entertainment value. While the film will likely draw and disappoint gay and female audiences, perhaps men can relate most to Mike and his checkered career in pursuit of a dream However, few straight men will venture into a movie with the advertising and subject matter of ""Magic Mike."""
401,Magic Mke,Hot dudes but that girl who plays Brooke is the WORST,5,Ok I have watched this a few times. Every time I do I get legitimately angry over that terrible actress that is cast as Brooke. Yikes. She can't act at all and her facial expressions are cringe worthy.She ruins the entire movie. So bad.
402,Magic Mke,Flashdance a la male style,6,"I went to see Magic Mike for two reasons--my friend LOVES to see guys strip and I had a cousin who worked as a stripper at the Hanger Club in Md. and kinda wondered what his tepid life was like?Well despite the many guys doing hoochie kootchie moves on the screen and the hype that went with it---I still found the plot boring while the whole movie seemed to drag it's way thru like an animal with an injured foot! Magic Mike had that old old plot line character study---The main character finally takes a good look at his sorted life while his new protégée seems to follow in his footsteps and is destined to replace him. That ole character switcheroo story has been done in endless plots. The acting is not bad but very very dry. Adam's sister always carries the same expression of disapproval throughout the whole movie while Adam---even through he is the new kid on the block---just keeps looking clueless and insipid with no emotion or expression at all. And the ending of the movie just leaves you flat that some people couldn't get it---but like Flashdance, the hero finds his right path or destination and wins.But most importantly, there are those tawdry naughty butt shaking strip scenes that made everyone pay the price of he movie ticket---but not enough scenes for the high prices today, Seeing this I can only say--my cousin must have had a screw loose in his head to do this for a living but it does show that a male stripper suffers in ""comfort"" from the booze, drugs and groupie followers that make it the good life!So go see it for the strip scenes, girls---no moving story, no good acting."
403,Magic Mke,Soderbergh's exploration of vacuous world of male stripping cannot offset tale of budding entrepreneur's redemption,4,"'Magic Mike' refers to the protagonist of the film, Mike Lane, played by Channing Tatum. Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike has aspirations to start legitimate businesses, including a custom furniture venture, but must work in the strictly cash male strip club world, in order to fund his other enterprises.Mike takes nineteen-year-old Adam under his wing who's just lost his construction job. Mike falls for Adam's medical assistant sister, Brooke, who looks at his involvement in male stripping with disdain. The film's sub-plot involves Mike's inner struggle to leave his sleazy lifestyle and court Brooke, who represents everything good, wholesome and clean.The main plot of the film involves Adam's fall from grace as he becomes seduced by drug dealers who peddle ecstasy. Adam and Mike perform at a private sorority party and are attacked by the sorority girls' boyfriends, who discover that Adam has been giving ecstasy to some of the girls. During this altercation, Adam leaves a bag worth $10,000 of ecstasy pills at the party and later Mike must pay off drug dealers who are now looking to get even with Adam.At film's end, Adam opts to move to Miami with Dallas who has opened up a bigger and better club. Mike finally has an epiphany that he'll never be able to realize his dreams as a legitimate business owner if he remains in the male strip club world and leaves Dallas and that world for Brooke, who is grateful that Mike bailed out her brother.If you're into male stripping (which I am not), this might be your cup of tea. There are plenty of scenes featuring the male strippers performing in various costumes, suggesting different venues. The female audience at the club seem to get off on the acts of simulated sex, but I suspect that most men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional. In addition to her devotion to her brother, she represents the wholesome world which Mike aspires to be part of. Hence, Cody Horn as Brooke, has little to do except wait for Mike as he finally transforms himself at the film's climax.Director Steven Soderbergh appears to be ambivalent about the male stripping world he's commenting on. On one hand, he recognizes that such a world is sleazy due to its many connections to the criminal element. For example, Adam's fall from grace is a direct result of his association with such elements. On the other hand, Soderbergh appears to revel in the actual performances of these male strippers (as evidenced by the amount of performance scenes he opts to include in his film). In the end, I wonder if exploring the male strip club world is worthy of a feature length film. Perhaps a documentary might have been more effective. Soderbergh's rather simplistic tale of redemption cannot offset the vacuousness of the world he has chosen to explore."
404,Magic Mke,Magic mike (2012),7,A good movie with an emotional level and strong forceful strength. Another great movie by Steven Soderbergh. Good performance by Channing Tatum.
405,Baby Ruby,Challenging Film to Get Thru,5,"If you're looking for narrative, cohesion, plot structure, etc. Look elsewhere. Also, if you have had major mental health issues, or breakdowns this is your trigger warning.The movie reminds me of a long, confusing nightmare. In dreams there are rarely beginnings, middles or ends. This movie explores the mental challenges of having a child. I'm not a parent, but everyone's experience is different and has its own challenges. In this film, the baby crying (it starts quickly in the plot so it's not a spoiler) is, at least to me where the breakdown starts.Overall it's like watching a nightmare. Part horror, part character study, part surrealist, but overall it doesn't really come together. Some parts are interesting overall it's not a pleasurable film going experience.If you're about to have a child or thinking of it I would not watch this movie. 5/10."
406,Baby Ruby,classification should add horror,8,"This film almost slipped underneath my radar. It isn't classified as a horror flick but it really is horror. At least the horror metatag should be added to it. I would avoid the trailer if you can because, umm, the trailer just gives the story away and ruins it like they often do.What brought me to try it were some of the cast members in it. Most notably is Kit Harington from Game of Thrones fame when he played Jon Snow. I like Jayne Atkinson's style too.If you haven't seen the trailer which I recommend you don't. The tension in the story crescendo as the online influencer, Jo, spirals down into madness caused by postpartum depression. We see her anxiety about motherhood and the baby. We experience her paranoia and her unbalance mental health. This isn't a jump scare flick, but a slow burn film, just like I want them. Some of the freight scenes I have not seen in other horror films that genuine shook me. Not easy to do since I watch hundreds of horror films. It has a Stephen King vibe to it when the group of mothers in the small town in Upstate New York. This is more geared to the older adult child bearing demographics. I doubt teens and younger adults will find it interesting."
407,Baby Ruby,That baby crying..,3,"That unending, incessant baby crying throughout the film was tortuous, but not as painful as sitting through ninety minutes of this movie.I had checked the IMDB ratings and originally, they were in the mid 7s but now they have sunk to the mid 5s. Rightfully so!The plot really never got off the ground although the tease of some potential was always around the corner.It did touch on the very real and serious subject of post partum depression but only used it as an excuse for the underdeveloped storyline.This was a feeble attempt at recreating a ""Rosemary's Babyish"" thriller, but fails miserably."
408,Baby Ruby,Exploring Postpartum Issues with Horror and Melodrama,5,"A debut film from playwright Bess Wohl that focuses on a French lifestyle blogger named Jo, who experiences postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. After giving birth to her baby Ruby, Jo begins to feel that her newborn is hostile towards her and she is unable to shake the feeling. The film keeps a close first-person perspective, showing Jo's increasingly paranoid mindset through shock cuts and hallucinatory elements, leaving the audience to question what is real and what is not. The movie's intent is to address the struggles that many new mothers face, but the constant use of horror tropes like pot boiling on the stove and repetitive ""did I just dream it or did it really happen"" moments drain away the power from the underlying message.The film's real bite comes from its cultural observation of entitled girl boss culture, the ""pick me girl"" turned new mom, and the private citizen acting like a celebrity/expert, but these elements are presented more as background noise rather than the main event. Ultimately, ""Baby Ruby"" falls short of fully exploring these important cultural issues and instead focuses on the horror and melodramatic elements of Jo's postpartum struggles."
409,Baby Ruby,Psychological PND Film,5,"I thought this sounded like an interesting concept, social media has baby and things go wrong is what I got from the synopsis.The film kind of went how I expected but lacked or even included too many things for it to be a good film.It lacked meat on the bones of the overall storytelling from her backstory to her life in general. It included too many different characters and themes without managing to nail any of them.It has a fairly dark dreary look which can add to the tone of a film and its not something I dislike but its done in a fairly weak manner that it never really hits you with any impact.When the focus here is on the lead actress you really need a great lead and Noémie Merlant never pulls it off. The melancholic feels are all there but everything else is just placid. The rest of the cast ( including Kit Harrington ) are bit players and often overlooked or put in a corner once their purpose has been served. Many of which serve little purpose that really get to you in an unnerving way as intended.You could remove a few characters and give others more to do and Im sure the impact would have been greater. I don't know an awful lot about Post Natal Depression so its difficult to comment on the realism in how it was used. Overall though it ended up being a bit disjointed and withering to a pretty anticlimactic ending.There are flickers of horror and an ever omnipresent haunting flow to the film but little else.5/10."
410,Baby Ruby,magnificent...,9,"And awestruck i am how well on the tip of the finger theyve managed to point at the thing they call''postpartum mental crisis'' or birth depression or newborn mum psychosis, its all there, in all kind of variations it may take, bundled into a freaked out, hilarious at moments ,screwed up mind thriller, called baby ruby.Theres a generic code for these kind of movies, but this one writes its own code. The acting is wonderful, the pace is well set, the cast acts out like burned in hell, so if youre an expectant mother to be, or have been through some issues yourself, this might rip up some of your wonderland expectations or wounds...so take a milky way and relax wile pumping the pumpkins, a crybaby isnt the worst that may unfold when the time comes, written and reviewed by the tripletted grumpy old man, still swaying strong like the wind in the willows, a recommend."
411,Baby Ruby,Real Life Horror,9,"Josie has a perfect life, friends, a job, and a loving husband, and is pregnant. She's nervous like any mother-to-be is, finding out later her mom passed when she was a baby. After she has the baby, things start to happen. She has an awkward experience in a baby store with a stranger and later they cross paths, she introduces Josie to a group of women who all have perfect babies, while Ruby cries all the time and Josie and her husband are exhausted. These women are like the Stepford Wives and made very much a cult IMO. Mix their advice about maternal instinct when her MIL's oversharing and lack of social cues and she thinks everything she does is wrong and something is wrong with the baby.If you've ever had a baby or been close to someone who has, you may recognize postnatal depression. It can open some conversations that are difficult and perhaps open people's eyes to what is a real-life horror."
412,Baby Ruby,Scared the hell out of me!,8,"I thought this was really scary and surprisingly good. I don't know if it is because I am a father or because I love horror films that deal with mental health issues. It was in fact so scared that I was not sure if I would be able to get through it.I also love this new trend of horror films that deal with the female body. Such an interesting concept.This is Bess Wohl's debut film as a director (she also wrote the script). I look forward to seeing what Bess Wohl will do in the future as a director. If this is any indication then we can expect something original and powerful.Noémie Merlant acts the hell out of this. This is not an easy role to play. She both does the role justice but at the same time did not to alienate the audience. I felt for her even though she scared the hell out of me.In short, this is one of those films that are way more interesting than the rating suggests."
413,Jurassic World:Dominion,"80% revisiting old characters and scenes, no real story, predictable action...it feels spiritless",3,"This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!It is so dull and predicatable.Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our ""favourite"" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart."
414,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Astonishingly bad, long and boring",2,"Bad script, bad acting, stupid story, a new dinosaur every 5 minutes, too long, no suspense, Chris Pratt doing the hand thing, $160 million dollar budget for this, so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took 2 and a half hours to tell me this garbage story.Frankly embarrassing to everyone involved."
415,Jurassic World:Dominion,"A generic, lifeless adventure movie that happens to have dinosaurs",3,"If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/9/2022)"
416,Jurassic World:Dominion,Sorry It Was So Bad,5,"Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie."
417,Jurassic World:Dominion,Things I learned from Jurassic World: Dominion...,1,"-Dinousaurs that only survived in warm climates can apparently thrive in cold winter climates-Between the time-span of the last movie several dinousaurs have quickly evolved into partial birds-You can effectively lasso an 8000lb Parasaurolophous on horseback-Velociraptors can get perfect traction running uphill in the snow-Velociraptors will chase you on a motorcycle at 50mph for several miles without tiring or considering going after the many pedestrians on foot along the way-Baryonyx; a dinosaur most paleontologists conclude hunted fish with it's long arms will devour a grown man-The ""Bird Raptor"" dinosaur can swim 50mph underwater and has perfect vision for hunting underwater even though it probably couldn't swim at all-A system put in place specifically to extinguish all of your contained giant locusts only serves to make them escape and continue to live on fire as long as it looks cool for the audience and is convenient to the ""plot""-Mosasaurus a giant predatory aquatic reptile is affectionate towards whales instead of eating them when it serves the ""feel good"" ending-Instead of doing proper fan service to the series, completely abandon the Jurassic Park universe and instead copy Star Wars, The Bourne Identity, Mission Impossible and X-Files then throw dinosaurs in there for good measure!"
418,Jurassic World:Dominion,They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park,6,"When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place."
419,Jurassic World:Dominion,"""You made a promise.... to a dinosaur?""",5,"Colin Trevorrow was so preoccupied with weather he could squeeze all his ideas into a film, he didn't stop to think if he should try and squeeze them all into his film. The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel. Being a huge JP fan, this could simply be a case of high expectations getting the better of me but the lack of exhilaration and awe upon leaving the cinema is painful."
420,Jurassic World:Dominion,"""Your screenwriters were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.""",3,"Honestly, I could have adapted any number of great Dr. Malcolm quotes from the other films to title this review, but this one perhaps sums it up best. (Be warned. I have a lot to say, so if you dislike long reviews, skip ahead now.)Here's where I'm coming from:1. Loved Jurassic Park, of course.2. Enjoyed Lost World but disappointed by its missed potential.3. LIKED Jurassic Park III (that's right, I'm the guy).4. Admired Jurassic World for recreating some of the awe of the original with a slight twist.5. Frustrated with Fallen Kingdom's disjointed structure and simplistic characters but its cliffhanger ending left me optimistic for the future.6. Dominion... Well, another Malcolm quote sums it up: ""That is one big pile of s**t.""The Jurassic World trilogy unfortunately has been one of diminishing returns. The first (JW) was a reimaging of the 1993 original (not unlike The Force Awakens was to A New Hope), but with an understanding of modern cynicism and apathy. An early line of dialogue summed up the theme: ""No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore."" Genetically creating a new scarier hybrid dinosaur was an interesting angle, as it kept the scientific focus of the original but provided a meta commentary not just on the JP franchise but on all Hollywood monster movies. While it was no masterpiece, Colin Trevorrow gave a new idea to ponder alongside the dinos, which neither Lost World nor JP III did.Fallen Kingdom was very messy. Since JW resolved its plot quite well, new storylines and characters were created out of thin air, and logic was pretty much thrown out the window. John Hammond had a partner? The island houses an active volcano? Human cloning going back years? Claire now works for PETA for dinosaurs? The last surviving raptor is John McClane? A Freddy Krueger like dinosaur was created that hunts children in their beds for the purpose of...military combat? Yet, for all of Fallen Kingdom's problems, J. A. Bayona at least gave us some new atmosphere and ended on an intriguing note. By releasing the dinosaurs into the mainland, the door was left open for a number of interesting directions to take the final film.What's baffling about Dominion is how it manages, at great effort, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (pardon the pun). It was supposed to be the franchise's grand denouement. The set up was there--a fastball down the middle --and instead of a homer they hit a long popup to left field while the audience waits with increasing disappointment for the inevitable catch. I didn't care to research what went wrong with Dominion's planning process, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple scripts with different ideas, and Trevorrow (back in the director's chair, and again one of the writers) decided ""let's use them all!...except for the one that examines the logistics of dinosaurs living amongst humans...that one can be trashed.""As other reviewers have discussed, dinosaurs are merely tangential to Dominion's messy plot. For much of the 2 1/2 hour runtime, it's easy to forget about them, since instead the film decides to focus on...the human characters (and locusts?). Aside from the original, the JP movies have had a consistent problem with its human roles, most either being annoying, doing inexplicably stupid things (even the good guys, Nick Van Owen, anyone?), or just being plain boring. It's the last one that hurts Dominion the most.In JW, Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Howard) were stereotypical but capable leads with some humorous interactions. Fallen Kingdom stripped away most of Owen's charisma and gave Claire's personality an unwelcome 180. In Dominion, Owen is now Generic Action Hero, and Claire has made a full transformation from Take-Charge Corporate Executive to a worried mother (over a child who isn't hers) who screams and panics a lot with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) when encountering bugs. So much for women inherit the earth. Maisie (Sermon) also returns from Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, instead of focusing on her grappling with being the first human clone, they've reduced her to an unlikeable angsty teen who serves as a MacGuffin for the others after she's kidnapped by the bad guys for reasons not entirely clear.Bringing back the original cast is pointless if you give them nothing interesting to do. Dr. Grant (Neill) is perhaps the saddest case. In the 20 years since we've last seen him he is still digging up dinosaur fossils and apparently has done nothing else with his life. He has fallen from an intelligent, capable leader to a clueless figure who mostly follows others around looking as confused and bored as the audience. Dern as Dr. Sattler fares the best; she is given the most to do and tries to inject life into the nonsensical plot. Goldblum as Dr. Malcolm is a welcome return, but our favorite nonconformist chaotician would NEVER go work for a genetics lab. Near the film's end he provides an amusing commentary on the movie's absurdity (e.g., his deadpan to Pratt: ""You made a promise to a dinosaur?"")Two more returning roles need mention. One of the more interesting things JW and Fallen Kingdom did was bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), making him a brilliant but self-indulgent geneticist. Wong sold it very well and it seemed like a natural progression for his character. He felt Hammond never gave him the respect he deserved (like Nedry), so he became determined to make bigger and greater accomplishments (i.e., hybrid monsters) than his former boss, unabashedly and at any cost. It was an interesting heel turn, making Dr. Wu (while never a major role) the most believable human antagonist of the series. Instead of resolving Wu's villainous arc, Dominion inexplicably reverses course and strips him of his hubris. Looking ungodly sick, Wu gives a mea culpa to Maisie for his creation of...giant locusts. No mention of his regret for recklessly creating the hybrid killing machines in the last two movies. Another good set-up from prior movies wasted.And then there's Dr. Dodgson (Scott). JP enthusiasts will remember the character's cameo in the first JP as the competing geneticist who hires Nedry to steal the embryos. And true fans know he played a more prominent role in the second novel. It seemed like an inspired choice to bring back Dodgson, a villain who connects to the plot of the first film and, by proxy, to its three returning heroes. Yet, in his interactions in Dominion with Sattler, Grant, and Malcolm, they never learn of his involvement in JP. Indeed, even Dodgson doesn't seem aware that they were involved in JP, although his character should certainly know that. But for a quick shot of the infamous muddied Barbasol can in his office, you could completely forget who he is. He acts more like an eccentric Steve Jobs with only one foot in reality than the cutthroat scientist he should be. ""We've got Dodgson here!""...yet ""nobody cares."" Nedry was right.If you've read up to this point (congratulations), you'll note I've barely mentioned the dinosaurs. Say what you will about the other movies, but at least they were all about the dinos. Many had distinct personalities that made them terrifying. One of Fallen Kingdom's mistakes was recrafting the sole surviving raptor (the villains of the first JP) as the hero, and raptors are no longer scary. Dominion goes further. Now the raptor (Blue) has reproduced (don't ask) and is a doting mother. There's no menace, and, further, Blue is sidelined for most of the film.Yes, there are dinosaurs, including other types of raptors. Dominion takes Fallen Kingdom's lame concept of laser-guided raptors and embraces it, resulting in a motorcycle/cargo plane chase through Malta that, while visually impressive (and welcome as the first action sequence 45 minutes in), belongs in a Bond or Bourne movie. (Dominion hops across several genres.)Where these never-before-seen dinosaurs came from is unknown. No more than 50 were released in Fallen Kingdom, and these new species were not among them. No explanation...moving on. Some new dinos in Dodgson's ""animal preserve"" (*cough* new park) seem interesting, although we don't know anything about them. To the film's credit, there is a tensely shot sequence involving Claire hiding in a lake from a spine-chilling carnivore. It's the closest Dominion comes to recreating the quiet fear of the original, and it's due to the movie deciding to slow down and take a welcome breath.Though why this lake is liquid when another lake in the same general area and time is frozen over enough to walk on shows a lack of continuity. It feels as though the creative team became entirely overwhelmed with the snowballing plot threads and characters that inconsistencies like this became commonplace. Trevorrow reportedly was pleased Covid delayed the film's release a year because it would allow them more time in post-production, yet with the uneven editing and overall breakneck pace, you wouldn't know it. They had extra time to edit together a cohesive, understandable plot and failed to do so.But Dominion's biggest sin is that it simply isn't scary. Aside from the noted lake sequence, there is no terror, no dread, no sense of dangerous awe. A new apex predator bigger than the T-Rex is supposed to frighten us. It doesn't. When the paths of the JP leads and JW leads finally merge while cornered by the big dinos, they act like they're in peril, but we don't buy it. We don't believe any of these stars will die (they don't), and we're not invested enough in them to care anyway. The characters lack agency, and it's boring. Dominion mostly swaps quiet scenes of terror of humans using their wits to face off against dinos (e.g., JP's T-Rex escape, raptors in the kitchen) for interchangeable dinos fighting each other in yawn-inducing brawls.During one of these, Dr. Grant notes aloud: ""This isn't about us."" How true, and how sad. Dominion fails to exert dominion over itself."
421,Jurassic World:Dominion,Absolute trash,2,"This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well. Just Hollywood doing what they do best."
422,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Wayne Knight said it best three decades ago: We got Dodgson here, and nobody cares.",4,"I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper."
423,Jurassic World:Dominion,A Bad 3:00 AM B-Movie Dressed in a Big Budget,2,"I'm going to make this short...Jurassic World: Dominion is like cleaning out your refrigerator and dumping a bunch of stuff in the trash. Only in this case, they decided to dump the ""stuff"" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don't really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up. This film is like watching a 3:00 AM B-movie that is so bad, it does its job by putting you back to sleep. And let's talk about the dinosaurs, velociraptors and various man-eating prehistoric creatures...nah, it's not worth it because other than the penultimate scene where the biggest and baddest were going at each other, they were simply an after-thought. Go figure.Everyone connected to this film tried to do too much and it didn't work as far as the storytelling is concerned. As I said before, they emptied the refrigerator and threw in everything in this film and it left a bad taste in my mouth because there was just too much ""stuff."""
424,Jurassic World:Dominion,Is anyone else tired of Chris Pratt and that damned hand?,6,"It's just amazing that no dinosaur hasn't bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. ""Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler"", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less."
425,Jurassic World:Dominion,"As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".",3,"I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%""."
426,Jurassic World:Dominion,Jurassic World Dominion,1,"Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money."
427,Jurassic World:Dominion,The old Jurassic formula just doesn't work anymore,1,"It's time to end the Jurassic franchise. This movie is just more of the same. They added giant locust in this one, so there's that. But really there was no reason to make this film. It's the same dinosaurs. The same dinosaur sounds. The same running jumping climbing swimming and hiding from dinosaurs. The same dramatic drawn out camera angles on the actors faces as they look either scared, concerned or all-knowing before scrambling to safety just in the nick of time. There was no real suspense because we knew our main characters would make it home safely. If the creators are insistent on making ANOTHER Jurassic film, please update the formula!"
428,Jurassic World:Dominion,As generic as Hollywood 'blockbusters' come. And I've seen a lot of 'em.,3,"Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon."
429,Jurassic World:Dominion,"No respect for popcuture and cineastic art - please, let the modern Hollywood go extinct",1,"Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic."
430,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Too long, some neat set-pieces",6,"I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10."
431,Jurassic World:Dominion,Insufferable,1,"I absolutely hated this film... legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers, a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable. The actors aren't at fault, the visuals are good (as you might expect from a movie this expensive), but the script is atrocious, and ""the epic conclusion"" is not very much a conclusion, the main issue is not solved, and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film, absolutely terrible film, don't watch it."
432,Jurassic World:Dominion,See the Original,4,This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies. The original was excellent and fun. This was an excuse to have a reunion. The movie can't stand on its own. I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies. He didn't get it. I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds. Not even camp enough to be fun.
433,Jurassic World:Dominion,The biggest disappointment of 2022!,3,"Wow, foiled again, a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up, it has a great cast, with some familiar faces, a big budget, so there's action galore, and some wonderful music, but a plot..... a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studio.How on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous, so empty, this film made me feel nothing, other than boredom. £40 that could have been used on so many other things.It's not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals, there needs to be some sort of plot, but there just isn't one, in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs, but of course you know what's going to happen. Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10."
434,Jurassic World:Dominion,Avoid Like the Plague,3,"Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one. This was just crap.***Final Thoughts: Easy listing of the Series. Hint: Only watch the 1st three listed below.1. Jurassic Park2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park3. Jurassic World97. Jurassic World Dominion98. Jurassic Park III99. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom."
435,Jurassic World:Dominion,"Wow, that movie was about as dumb as they come!",2,"The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while. The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here. As a conclusion to this trilogy, it fails in a majority of areas. Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5."
436,Jurassic World:Dominion,"RIP logic, evolution, adaptation and physics.",1,"From the very first opening scene, to the ability to lasso a giant dinosaur on horseback in only the first 10 mins, had me rolling my eyes so much I almost went blind.This film is made EXACTLY like some Christian creationist and a conspiracy theorists got together to ""brainstorm"" what they think the world would be like with dinosaurs in it. Apparently the writers, producers and director think you can just stick any animal in any environment and it will thrive.They also think evolution works in months and a couple years and not tens and even hundreds of millions of years.I understand this is Sci first, but they're trying to make it believable, you CAN NOT have it both ways, pick a lane!Then you have the incredibly boring and dragged out plot. They literally might aswell just flipped us the finger at this point.Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life and the original cast should be ashamed of themselves for selling out dignity for a quick pay check.The reviews on this piece of trash are definitely accurate, I mean, how did they direct, edit and produce this, see the end result and be like ""yup, this is how a trilogy is supposed to end""? Seen B and C movies from the 80s far superior to whatever this is."
437,Jurassic World:Dominion,Are we serious?!,2,"Truly a shameful film made in a hurry and without a plot that is linear or otherwise makes sense. Since Jurassic World in 2015 the Jurassic saga has gone to die, with dinosaurs that were better made in 1993 and with characters that try to retrace the steps of the main protagonists of Jurassic Park but fail to even be iconic for the film itself. Somebody has to stop them, they are ruining a saga that was never supposed to be revived again, it was over in 2001 and I still ask myself now, ""but was it really needed?"" I sincerely hope that this is the last chapter, although I'm afraid not, because really how can you put locusts as the villain of the movie... ARE WE KIDDING? I would have expected anything, but locusts don't. Then there are some characters in particular Henry Wu who in the previous 2 chapters was the villain who created monsters and here instead he wants to save everyone but for no good reason, they don't explain why Wu became good from one moment to the next and this angers people no end. Let's not talk about how they evolved Maisie Lockwood's character because I really found her ridiculous. One of the worst movies of this year, someone needs to stop this CRAZY."
438,Blonde,Blonde,5,"What a truly disappointing film this is. It offers us a really slow, sterile and disjointed - almost episodic - depiction of just how Marilyn Monroe's life might have panned out. For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women."
439,Blonde,Poor Marilyn,5,"If you're going to fictionalize the life of one of the movie icons of the 20th century why go there, to the darkest dark. There are some ""invented"" moments that are, quite frankly, unforgivable. What kept me glued to the screen was Ana de Armas. A tremendous show of talent and fearlessness. I was wondering what the experience would have been to watch it in a theater with other people? I don't know because in the privacy of my own home I was free to stand up and walk away to pour myself a drink and shout at the screen. The awful Kennedy episode for instance. Why? That episode in particular made me question the intention of the filmmakers. So, yes, I can say now that I've seen it. Loved some it and detested some it."
440,Blonde,"A disjointed, episodic look at Monroe's miseries! [+42%]",4,"""Blonde"" is sadly reduced to the collective tragedies (and horrors) that the iconic actress went through in her short 36-year-old life. Don't get me wrong, Ana de Armas totally owns the role and gives it her all (God bless her cheekbones!). She also gets worthwhile support from the cinematography, production design, costume, and make-up departments. The biggest letdown is the script that heavily lacks connective tissue between what feels like various disjointed episodes in Monroe's life. Again, each of these episodes are stripped down to repetitive plot-points such as the absentee father, the abortions, the failed marriages, and most importantly, the male gaze.Writer-director Andrew Dominik perceives Marilyn Monroe and Norma Jeane as two distinct personas, the former being a glowy, on-screen cover-up for the distressed latter. Again, because the film is only interested in showcasing the worst of her life, as viewers, we feel disconnected early on, especially given the film goes on for a butt-numbing 160 minutes. Also, I didn't particularly like the transition between black & white and color bang in the middle of certain scenes. What was the underlying point? The film basically leaves Armas to do most of the heavy lifting since the script only attempts to look at her as an object of desire.Of course, there are more than a few controversial stretches in the film, and if that's barring a scene with a speaking foetus, then I'm probably dreaming it all up. This isn't what Norma would've wanted to be seen as her ""legacy"", and both entries Netflix has come up with thus far on Marilyn Monroe (yes, I'm looking at you The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes) are lacklustre."
441,Blonde,Only the negative side of Miss Monroe,6,"The movie ""Blonde"" is based on the fictional novel about Marilyn Monroe's life by writer Joyce Carol Oates. Director and also writer Andrew Dominik adapted it for the screen. Like a fictionalized chronicle, Oates mixes actual facts with imaginary ones to depict a troublesome woman being used and abused by Holywood.The movie is very depressing as it describes in detail Marilyn's dark past and how it affected her self-esteem, character, and vulnerability to all her predators. The movie ""Blonde"" is based on the fictional novel about Marilyn Monroe's life by writer Joyce Carol Oates. Director and also writer Andrew Dominik adapted it for the screen. Like a fictionalized chronicle, Oates mix actual facts with imaginary ones to depict a troublesome woman being used and abused by Holywood.The movie is very depressing because it describes in detail Marilyn's dark past and how it affected her self-esteem, character and vulnerability to all her predators. Also shocking are the scenes that show how Marilyn wanted to have children and her miscarriages. This is the biggest problem with the movie, by choosing only the negative side of Marilyn's life, there is a point it becomes repetitive. From the first scene till the credits roll, we witness the cruel and sad life of another star who at the height of his career cannot bear the pressure of living in a glamor bubble."
442,Blonde,Monotone and unbalanced piece,2,"I knew this was meant to be divisive but I didn't expect to dislike it this much.Technically it is mostly well crafted (except for the very questionable editing). The acting is good - Ana de Armas is great, in fact -, but this script is terrible. I mean, I can understand what the director tried to achieve with this. I get the goals - he wanted to show all the tragedies in her life and how that culminated in the way she was and she ended her life. But it is so focused on the same single note over and over again that it is tedious and, to be honest, gives you very few reasons to keep watching. We already knew this wouldn't be a happy portrayal of Marilyn, but lacks any kind of balance to be a good work. I have no doubts that this was a big part of who she was, but she was much more than that and this film refuses to acknowledge that even with almost 3 hours of runtime.Stupidly long for what it tries to say - that is clear with 15 minutes -, tiring and never an engaging piece. One of those films that I am 100% sure I will never revisit it.PS: That blowjob scene is...uncomfortable, but, above all, pathetic. And, yes, distasteful and exploitative are adjectives we can use to qualify a big part of this film."
443,Blonde,buck up for this one,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have studied Marilyn Monroe's personal and professional life, writer-director Andrew Dominik's (first feature film since KILLING THEM SOFTLY, 2012) interpretative adaptation of the 2000 novel by Joyce Carol Oates may send them into the early stages of shock. In fact, regardless of one's level of knowledge of the details of Marilyn's background, shock and bewilderment are likely reactions. It should be made clear for all viewers that it's a fictionalized account of her life, not a true biography. One should also know that this is cinematic artistic mastery to complement an incredibly in-depth and revolutionary performance from Ana de Armas (KNIVES OUT, 2019, NO TIME TO DIE, 2021).At times, the film is surreal, while at others, downright hallucinatory. It's certainly never boring. However, it's a disturbing beatdown and a grueling watch for a single sitting at close to three hours long. The film begins in 1933 with a young Norma Jeane (Lily Fisher) living in poverty and misery with her single mom Gladys (a terrific Julianne Nicholson). Mom has obvious mental issues and would much prefer Norma Jeane not be around. It's here where the 'Daddy issues' take hold - issues that stick with the girl for the remainder of her life. After being rejected by her father, her mother, and the friendly neighbors, Norma Jeane ends up in an orphanage. A montage takes us through her teenage modeling years, where we see the beginnings of her being taken advantage of and treated as a commodity.There is an extended sequence involving the threesome of Marilyn and the sons of Hollywood legends Charlie Chaplin and Edward G Robinson (Xavier Samuel, Evan Williams, respectively), and a vicious rape scene with a studio head ""Mr. Z"" (hmmm). Marilyn's first pregnancy leads to an abortion, which is the first of a few tragedies she will experience - and director Dominik finds an entirely new (and bizarre) method of filming these occurrences. The Joe DiMaggio (Bobby Cannavale) and Arthur Miller (Oscar winner Adrien Brody) marriages are noted, yet the men go unnamed, instead referred to as ""former athlete"" and ""playwright"" ... as if somehow that will trick us.Of course, all of these relationships are right in line with her ""Daddy issues"" ... Marilyn even goes so far as to call these men ""Daddy"", in hopes that one will finally give her the love and acceptance she so craves. One of the more uncomfortable scenes (and that's saying something) involves her tryst with JFK (also unnamed), played by Caspar Phillipson, whose uncanny resemblance to the former President has resulted in his casting for the role in multiple projects. It's likely this White House moment, replete with Marilyn's inner voice, is responsible for the film's NC-17 rating.Dominik and cinematographer Chase Irvin recreate some of the most memorable film moments from Marilyn's career ... including the subway vent scene from THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. After capturing that film magic, the sequence seems to drag on with leering onlookers and what proved to be the final straw with DiMaggio. A recurring feature involves Marilyn receiving and reading letters from the father she's never met - including promises of meeting ""soon."" The payoff for this is disappointing for us and for her.Perhaps the main point of Dominik's movie is the enormous gulf and psychological contrast between Norma Jeane, the eternally-scarred young girl, and Marilyn Monroe, the iconic bombshell she created for public consumption. There is a sadness about her most of the time, even when she flips that switch to become Marilyn - the familiar sultress adored by so many. Toby Huss plays Whitey, a version of real-life Allan Snyder, who was Marilyn's long-time make-up artist and confidant. Her famous diary gets a mention, and we see the price she paid for taking drugs to calm anxiety while dealing with the crushing weight of fame.Ana de Armas delivers a performance for the ages. Of course, the scrutiny she will face playing one of the most famous women of all-time will be senselessly nitpicky, yet from an artistic standpoint, her work is supreme. Costume Designer Jennifer Johnson somehow manages to nail the different stages, films, and moods (of both the film and its subject). Is this exploiting the woman who made a career out of being exploited? Or is it simply telling a story? Norma Jeane was a fragile creature constantly victimized as she desperately searched for love. Has the filmmaker continued that abuse with this vision? From a moviemaking aspect, it's' a thing of beauty. From a human perspective, it's torturous to watch. If you are in need of a 'feel-good' movie, keep searching. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for the work of a cinematic visionary and one of the best acting performances of the year, settle in.Opens on Netflix September 23, 2022."
444,Blonde,Let Marilyn RIP,1,"Anyone who knew about or cared about Marilyn would have written a movie about a beautiful, vulnerable creature who came across as so lovable on the screen, yet never got the love she deserved from those close to her.If someone wants to make a twisted, raunchy movie, they are free to do so. What is wrong is to USE a famous icon to do it. The author of the book and the director/writer of the movie could have created a fictional Monroe type character but they chose not to. Why? Because they knew if they exploited a beloved icon they'd get far more attention. They are p*mping this poor woman.Marilyn Monroe had a difficult, unstable and lonely childhood. She had no one to protect her and no one to guide her. She struggled long and hard to become a star. She was built up by a studio who saw her looks, charisma and raw talent. She was basically a piece of meat to them.The public adored her, but she had to struggle to cope and survive as a beautiful actress in 1950s Hollywood. She was mostly a gentle, sensitive soul. This obviously had to be difficult for her.She turned to pills to be able to sleep, and pills to keep her weight down. She was on a foggy roller coaster ride. She had friends who wouldn't or couldn't help her. The most desired woman in the world was basically alone to fight for herself. On top of that, I've read old movie magazine articles of the time calling her old at 36!Marilyn is still an icon 60 years since her death. Why? People still love watching her in her films. She personifies glamour, vulnerability and sensuality all in one. People identify with her vulnerability and some of the problems she faced. They also realize her untapped potential.This woman made people happy and made people laugh. She made mistakes like anyone else with no guidance and on their own. Still, she wasn't a ruthless, nasty person. I doubt she ever got as much as she gave.Let her rest. Don't make up some twisted story and use her tragedy to promote your book, movie or yourself. She was used enough in her lifetime."
445,Blonde,Bold and exceptionally well-made,8,"Blonde was already one of the most controversial and hotly debated films of the year before it hit Netflix, and therefore became available to the public at large. That's happened within the last day or two, and I expect that will blow up the discussion and discourse around it even more. It's probably going to be what most film news sites or discussion groups focus on for the next week or two, and maybe longer if it ends up earning some nominations for the upcoming awards season.I don't want to talk about the controversy too much, but it's important to address it briefly. Truthfully, I don't understand most of it. This film is shocking in parts, yes, but not as bad as a lot of the early discussions surrounding it made it sound. Almost none of the scenes that involve sex or nudity are presented in a titillating way, and they're all over quite quickly. There's very little about it that's supposed to be erotic, and I think that's evident by how the camera tends to lock onto Norma Jean's face, to emphasize the pain, discomfort, and trauma she feels during those scenes.So is it exploiting that pain, discomfort, and trauma? That seems to be the other big talking point. I didn't think so. I think the film was sympathetic to her, and aimed to showcase how misogynistic the film industry was at the time Norma Jean/Marilyn Monroe was active within it. It's arguably not much better nowadays, but whether these exact things happened to her or not feels somewhat beside the point. The fact is, things similar to this did almost certainly happen to Monroe and other young actresses. That idea is horrifying, and I think the film successfully painted it as horrifying.Ana de Armas is fantastic in the lead role. She'll probably get some nominations come awards season. The rest of the cast are solid, the film is visually stunning from start to finish, and I loved the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (at least one track was a repurposed instrumental from Ghosteen, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' last album, but it fit so well I didn't mind).For complaints about the filmmaking itself? The nearly three-hour runtime might be a little indulgent, but for the most part it earns it. There are also some occasionally strange and baffling creative decisions, but for every one that doesn't work, there's at least several strange creative decisions that do.I thought Blonde was pretty great overall. I understand to a limited extent why it's become controversial, but can't wrap my head around the magnitude of that controversy. Still, if it's got people angry, I don't plan to wade into any discourse or make discussions more heated. I've defended it here and said my piece. I think it's very good."
446,Blonde,Mixed feelings,7,Ana de armas gave an inspiring performance and she really acted her heart out. The story and it's execution was a masterpiece at places and the cinematography and aesthetics were on a new level. As I don't know that much about marlyn I don't actually care how they portrayed her. The main accomplishment of the film is that it shows the horrors of Hollywood masterfully and how sometimes famous people or actors lose themselves as a person underneath the limelight and become somewhat of a lost soul. In some respects they failed to make it feel impactful and it seemed disjointed sometimes. But to see ana de armas act her heart out and netflix do something new is truly refreshing. And it's such a long film but surprisingly didn't seem dragged.
447,Blonde,Why Tell Fictional Stories About a Real Person?,2,"Marilyn Monroe was a great artist and this movie could've been a great opportunity to teach younger audiences about who she was. But for some reason, they decide to tell a fictional story. She has the same name, plays in the same movies, and sings the same songs, but many events are made up. It's so misleading when movies do this. It's not a movie about Marilyn Monroe, it's a movie about a mentally ill actress. Monroe was more than a mentally ill sex symbol. She was intelligent and a great artist - which doesn't come across in this movie.Ana de Armas is okay in the movie. She looks and sounds like Monroe, but she is naked for an uncomfortable amount of time in the movie. It's not just the fact that she's naked, but she's naked for no apparent reason. If her being naked adds nothing to the story you might as well let her put some clothes on."
448,Blonde,Two Personalities in one Body,8,"I really liked it a lot. Andrew Dominik showed us the dark side of Marilyn Monroe simply becuase nobody dared to do this before and there was (for sure) a dark side of her. I liked how he portrayed Monroe as two differnt characters that try to allign with each other. Ana de Armas perfeclty portrayed this rollercoaster of emotions. Showed us a pitch perfect - by the standards - Marilyn and her alter ego Norma Jean perfectly in ambiance. She truly gave one of the best performances I have seen all year and hopefully will get the deserved attnetion coming awards season for it.I do no understand all the scandal buzz around that film as there was not really anything scandalous about it execpt that it showed us the probably most famous Hollywood icon in a completely different light.The only thing you can blame Andrew Dominik for is that he still did not let us as close to Marilyn as I hope it would be. Yes he gave us a different version of that known personaity however we never felt close to her. But i guess this might have been intentionally. Because can you be close to such an icon and legend - to the symbol of Hollywood?The length of the film did not bother me at all - in fact I was afraid a bioic that long that just focuses on one person could have lenghts. Not this one. I was captued to the screen the whole time, thanks to the perfect performances by Ana de Armas but also the creative technical decisions that were chosen. Fantastic cinemtography and score, linked with a very intersting editing.All in all the experiment worked out in my opinion."
449,Blonde,Heartbreaking,7,"I have no idea how accurate this account of Marilyn Monroe's life is. I will say that there are some people in Norma Jean's life that, if this account is even close to accurate, are hopefully rotting in hell. This movie portrays a woman desperately in need of help who is tormented by many of the people that she chose to trust. A lot of ""heroes"" don't come out of this looking too good. Norma Jean comes out as a woman with massive insecurities and likely mental illness, who is abused and manipulated by many, many people, some of which claimed to love her, others of which simply wanted to make money off her,."
450,Blonde,Exploitive and flat,2,"Three hours of sheer boredom with the whole focus of the film being on Norma Jean's father who abandoned her mother before she was born. Nothing new on offer. A lot of nude shots, Marilyn calling her husbands ""Daddy"" the babies she couldn't have, her intelligence got short shrift and her drug taking a huge focus, fed by her handlers.John F. Kennedy, the womanizer, is depicted in a particularly revolting scene.Shock value ruled the day and nothing new was added.Totally disappointing and the words that comes to mind are crude and vulgar. Good imitative performance from Ana.But not worth a re-watch or an award of any kind.2/10."
451,Blonde,A Unique and Visually Riveting Biopic,7,"I am not a Marilyn Monroe junkie, nor do I know that much about her life and career. I also was concerned that this movie is 3 hours long. This is a an Andrew Dominik film, based on a best selling book of the same title. The film is unusual and brilliantly done. It is a stream of consciousness that plays out more like a dream than a movie. It is visually stunning. The look and the details of this movie are stunning and breathtaking at parts. Ana de Armas is so unmistakeable as Marilyn Monroe that it is eerie. The effects working her into the actual Monroe films are seamless. The supporting case of actors are wonderful. This is a heavy dark movie in so many ways. It is a biography, but it is also the struggle of Norma Jean to distinguish herself from Marilyn Monroe, the character. It is also and ode to love, and to finding peace and identity through love. This movie is unique and brilliant, but it is not for someone looking for an easily digestible, chronological telling of the life of Marilyn Monroe. Much was made of the NC-17 rating; however, these scenes feed the story, not exploit it in my opinion. Netflix was bold in supporting this great project."
452,Blonde,All the misery - non of the greatness,1,"As usual Hollyweird goes overboard and destroys another icon. Instead of telling us about both the bitter and the sweet - they settle on the bad. All the bad, ugly, dark and crazy, that's what they like to show us. No... they want to ram it down the viewers throat, again, and again, and again, and again. You think I'm being repetitive? Oh, that's nothing compared to the movie.Off course it's beautifully shot and DeArmas is a decent actress, but mostly overacting in this role. The side characters are bland at best but just not there most of the time. What made Marilyn such a great star? Well... they not gonna tell you in this movie. All they have time to do is give you the misery. And that's how you will be after watching this - miserable."
453,Blonde,Marilyn deserved better!,6,"Blonde review :A supposed biopic on the Hollywood diva Marilyn Monroe; Blonde has a scene where a group of snobbish oldies ask a young Monroe if her blonde hair is real? To which he hesitantly replies No. The moment is given a surreal touch depicting the insecurities of a star who had faced a troubled childhood and was a lonely loser beneath all that gloss and glamour.The film's biggest positive is of course Ana De Armas who literally gets in to the skin of the titular character. Her transformation from the diffident Norma Jeane to the movie star Marilyn is truly incredible and full marks to her for getting it bang on...brilliant indeed!Director Andrew Dominik doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Monroe's life whether it was her blatant exploitation by the filmmakers of that era or her illicit relationship with the President of United States. It's all there and in all its gory details!! Marilyn's ""threesome"" relationship is also explored uninhibitantly.On the flipside, the pacing is super slow and some scenes just don't make any sense. Like Norma hallucinating an abortion. Also, Monroe's (in)famous skirt blowing moment in The Seven Year Itch (1955) is filmed in multiple angles here with her undergarments on full display reeking of cheap titillation. Ooff!With all its plus and cons, Blonde aint too bad for a Netflix watch. It could've been a far better movie though.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
454,Blonde,Disgusting,1,"This was so difficult to get through. It felt so messy and everything was one tone the entire way through, it was disaster after disaster with no room to breathe. I feel like even though this was a long film it didn't show who Monroe actually was, it focused on everything bad which I see what they were trying to do and what led her to taking her life but it was too much. There is also very sexual (sexual assault) scenes and they are so uncomfortable and unnecessary and felt a little disrespectful to show especially for that long! A lot of unnecessary nudity to be honest and abortion scenes which were too long and showed way too much and this happened 2/3 times it was horrific. This movie had these problems the entire way through and it was 3 hours! It was way too long for what we got, not worth the watch at all."
455,Blonde,Ana de Armas Uncannily Channels Marilyn in an Overlong Movie Infused with Relentless Pain,8,"Look at her eyes. Look at the spot-on reenactments of her classic movie moments (especially ""Some Like It Hot""). Ana de Armas' transformation into Marilyn Monroe is devastating, heartbreaking, and so completely accurate that it comes across less as an imitation and more like an inhabitation of the legendary actress' soul. Lugubriously directed by Andrew Dominik, this overlong 2022 film is not a straight-up biopic but an episodic cautionary tale of pre-Harvey Weinstein abuse and power politics taken from a startling first-person perspective. Based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2001 novel, the story is not only tragic but painful to watch with trauma erupting in almost every scene. Look past de Armas' Oscar-worthy work if you can, and you'll see strong work from Julianne Nicholson as her disturbed mother and Adrien Brody as the Arthur Miller character. Why it received an NC-17 rating became clear toward the end."
456,Blonde,Unnecessarily Naked...,7,"A young woman, disturbed, tortured and scarred by her childhood; abused, exploited and manipulated by those she most trusts; anxious, afraid and troubled by what she really wants and what she actually has, spirals into chaos and despair, cascades into confusion and mayhem, and pays the ultimate price for fame and fortune, for pleasing others above herself, while sacrificing the innocence that endears her to the world.Longer than your typical movie, it's only through the compelling and gripping performance of Ana de Armas that it gets away with that longevity, although the subject matter of this grim, fictionalised telling generally captures most people's attention, but I'm not sure the exposure she gets throughout really adds to the value."
457,Blonde,"This is not a movie, it's an exploitation film",1,"This is not a movie, this is a snuff film passed as a movie because the subject was a real person.Norma Jean Baker, also known as Marilyn Monroe is played by Ana de Armas in this exploitation film, where they faithfully recreate events that never happened, as if the writers were thinking ""What else could we do to this woman""?Don't get me wrong, Marilyn Monroe suffered a lot in life, she was abused as a younger child, and suffered all kinds of psychological, sexual, and physical abuse in her adult life, her story is already tragic without these ""writers"" just adding more unnecessary trauma for shock value.Whoever made this snuff film should never make another movie again."
458,Blonde,It's a horror movie not a biopic,8,"People who wanted a Marilyn biopic turn away. It's not that. The book on which the film is based is a creepy slink through the darkness of Hollywood and the machine of goddess creation. Those who think Marilyn Monroe was a good girl are naive and uninformed. She was a real woman with needs and addictions who lived pretty wildly for most of her life. The scenes with the talking fetus are not for me, and seem rather by rote and pro-life, representing a full baby when it would have been a few cells at the point of her abortions. Also cloying is the suggestion she was obsessed with finding her father, which was overplayed here.However, most of the movie Ana de Armas pulls off a brilliant performance, and although some on here have criticised her accent, it should be said that you are forgetting Marilyn worked on various accents with foreign lilts, just listen to her in Niagra and Some Like It Hot to hear her added Latina or French accents on words. Her voice changed depending on who she was talking with, and de Armas pulls this off, unfortunately her being Cuban will mean this clever trick will be misinterpreted as her doing the accent wrong.The violence and famous JFK scene is both grotesque and necessary, and reminded me of Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. This film doesn't destroy an icon but shows another side to her life, and how it would have been for women in Hollywood. Showing them as Vestals for gods was an interesting angle, and don't forget, from the book written by a woman.People are saying, can't there be some happy moments? But no, this film is about the darkness, and wants you to feel the pain she endures over and over while trying to exist. It gets Lars Von Trier dark at times.The scenes where Norma channels Marilyn are genius, and Neon Demon-like. Unfortunately, maybe sixty percent of people watching this film will insist on hating it, because they wanted it to be a biopic. Oh well. I'm glad it was made, even if it was a bit flawed."
459,Blonde,Was Expecting Worse,6,"After all of the terrible Internet reviews, I was expecting much worse from ""Blonde."" While I agree that it's not a great, or maybe even very good, movie, it's not terrible, and I'll admit that things about it got under my skin and stayed there, which is always the sign of at least effective filmmaking.I'm sick to death of biopics, and I don't have much interest in Marilyn Monroe. I don't care for her style of acting, and I'm too young to have been witness to her cultural impact at the time she was living. So from the start I'm not the ideal audience for this movie. And I don't know that I fully understand the point of it. I didn't know going in that it was speculative fiction based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel, so I spent much of the running time wondering how accurate it was. It's a 3 hour marathon of nothing but terrible things happening to Monroe, and it all just starts to feel like exploitative misery porn without any point other than that the Hollywood industry treats people, especially women, badly, as if we didn't already know that. There seems to be some effort to show us that Monroe was more than just a dumb blonde, but a feeble effort at best. We don't really ever get to know her or understand her inner life, so she mostly remains an object for the film to abuse. It really just made me feel bad, and I'm tired of seeing movies this year that seem to exist for the sole purpose of making their audiences feel bad. There's been a lot of them.Ana de Armas sure gives herself to the role, but I started to feel almost embarrassed by all the things the movie made her do, and did to her. After a while it felt like I was walking in on her in the middle of a bowel movement. As I write this, de Armas was just nominated for an Oscar for her performance. I don't begrudge her the nomination, because A for effort I guess, though hers wasn't one of my particular favorite performances of the year. And she can't lose her accent for anything.But like I said upfront, the movie did manage to make me feel something, even if that something was mostly bad, which is more than a lot of films do.Grade: C+"
460,Blonde,Enough of the Marilyn Monroe Exploitation,1,"Marilyn Monroe was exploited in life, and she's being mega-exploited in death. Blonde is pure unadulterated exploitation of a woman who simply should be left alone to rest in peace. I don't care what Ana De Armas or that bloviating director tries to say about this film or the multitude of excuses they use...it's trash. The entire film is a lesson in exploitation 101. De Armas is not at all convincing as Monroe and the utterly despicable scenes in Blond would make Attila the Hun cringe and look away. There's nothing more to say except...I hope this disrespectful piece of dreck is the last time someone tries to make money on Marilyn Monroe by constantly exploiting her and dragging her out of her grave just because they can. Enough is enough."
